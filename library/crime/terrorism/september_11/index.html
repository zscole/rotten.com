When you look at the minute-by-minute account of what happened on September 11, a few things become clear.<p>
One inescapable conclusion is that most agencies of the U.S. government suffered a near-total failure to perform their stated functions. <p>
It's debatable whether the government could have actually lessened or prevented any deaths by doing its job that day. What is painfully clear, however, is that just about everyone who <b>could</b> drop the ball <b>did</b> drop the ball. <p>
Nothing functioned the way it was supposed to, and America was leaderless in most meaningful senses for the entire duration of the most stunning homeland attack in history. <p>
Eventually, a leader finally did emerge, a forceful figure giving orders and making the tough calls from the nerve center of the American government. Unfortunately, that leader did not happen to be the constitutionally elected President of the United States. <p>
The following minute-by-minute chronology is not filled with <a href="/library/conspiracy/september_11_conspiracy_theories/">controversial half-truths</a>. All of the facts below are firmly established, with only two serious exceptions, both of which are specifically highlighted in the text.<p>
The main body of the story is largely drawn from numerous staff reports by the 9/11 Commission, which are by far the primary source. A handful of juicy details were drawn from "A Pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and the Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies" by James Bamford and "Against All Enemies" by <a href="/library/bio/usa/richard-clarke/">Richard A. Clarke</a>. A few additional details came from timelines published by the New York Times, the Washington Post and CNN, as well as official White House records of the day. <p>
The tale that unfolds here is long and painful, but important. Those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it. The list of mistakes made on September 11, 2001, is daunting. But we can't afford to repeat them. 

<h2>When Ignorance Is Understandable</h2>

<img src="/library/crime/terrorism/september_11/atta2-smaller.jpg" height="236" width="300" align=right hspace=10 vspace=5>

During the first phase of the attack, it took a few minutes to figure out what was happening. That isn't surprising. But while air traffic controllers on the front lines quickly figured out the significance of what they were hearing, the FAA and other managers failed to treat this information with the urgency and speed it demanded. <p>

The result? While ground-level workers in every branch of government did their best to address the situation, key middle managers sat frozen in indecision and effectively stopped the movement of vital information both up and down the chain of command.

<h2>When Ignorance Is Not Understandable</h2>

Once the formal notice of a hijacking reached Washington, D.C., you would expect the well-oiled mechanisms of national security to snap into place with lightning-like speed. Unfortunately, nothing of the sort happened. Instead, the FAA acted as a lethal information sink, taking calls from around the country but failing to pass the information along. NORAD was not much better. Although fighters were dispatched quickly, they weren't given any orders, which rendered them pointless. <p>

While NORAD did send orders DOWN the chain of command, virtually no information about what was happening traveled UP the chain of command. Between NORAD and the FAA, middle managers and bureaucrats were making ALL the decisions about how to handle what was quickly evolving into a wartime crisis. <p>

Meanwhile, a full half-hour into the crisis, the White House and the nation's top intelligence officials were getting <b>ALL</b> of their information from television news, and even that information was not being distributed efficiently. <p>

So the president of the United States shrugged off a full-scale assault on his country in favor of listening to elementary school students read, while the director of the <a href="/library/conspiracy/cia/">CIA</a> ate breakfast, the acting commander of the combined armed forces schmoozed with a congressman for 45 minutes, the director of the <a href="/library/conspiracy/nsa/">NSA</a> conducted a routine staff meeting and the vice president only found out what was going on when he plopped down in front of a TV.

<h2>Shoot To Kill! </h2>

With the benefit of hindsight, we know that the crash of United 93 shortly after 10 a.m. was the end of the immediate crisis. At the time, however, no one knew what else could happen. The sky was falling. <p>
Two hours into the attack, there was still no coordinated response from the American government. In fact, as the hours passed, it became agonizingly clear that the U.S. government barely even knew which planes had crashed where. <p>
In fact, the only possible order which could have made a difference -- the order to shoot down planes which refused to divert from attack routes -- was given 10 minutes after the last hijacked plane had already crashed. <p>
While the order was probably right and sensible, the sad fact is that the horse was long, long gone by the time the barn door was locked.

<h2>That's 'President' Cheney To You...</h2>

<img src="/library/bio/usa/dick-cheney/cheney-rumsfeld.jpg" height="225" width="300" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>

As we have seen, the shoot-to-kill orders were given to the military by the Vice President.
<p>

It is perhaps worth noting at this point the mere technicality that the vice president has no statutory power to give orders during a moment of crisis in which the president is NOT incapacitated.
<p>

Technically, Bush was not incapacitated at this moment, except perhaps for being rendered insensate by his overwhelming desire to get back to Washington and face danger like a man. Technically, the next person after Bush who is authorized to give the "shoot to kill" order, is Donald Rumsfeld and not Dick Cheney. The President cannot delegate his commander-in-chief authority outside the chain of command. That's why they have a chain in the first place.
<p>

Though tempting, it's hard to fault Cheney in this situation. Frankly, if you yourself happened to be walking through the White House bunker on that day, and someone ran up to you and asked "should we shoot down a hijacked aircraft headed right for us," you would have felt justified in saying "shoot first and ask about the appropriate constitutional delegation of authority later."
<p>

The more pertinent question is: Why wasn't the President running things?
<p>

There are military bases in Florida with everything Bush could have needed to take charge of the situation, while a more secure facility was prepared. And there were multiple facilities suitable for housing the president in this sort of  crisis.
<p>

Instead, as the entries above and below illustrate, Bush was content to let Cheney call the shots -- literally -- on what was indisputably the most important day of his presidency.

As far as anyone credibly knows, no one actually "took a couple of aircraft out." Also, as previously noted, none of the pilots had been informed of their shootdown authorization.

<h2>Why Even Have An Air Force One?</h2>

<img src="/library/crime/terrorism/september_11/911-bush-offut.jpg" height="266" width="310" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>

It's worth breaking out of our chronology for a moment here to consider Air Force One, in which the president of the United States is currently sitting. The entire point of mythologizing Air Force One is the idea that the President can -- in theory -- run the country from anywhere his plane can go. Air Force One is fitted with secure phone lines, secure data lines, radios, televisions, even a fax machine. It has 85 phone lines and requires three operators to run it. It has a fully equipped presidential office, and on September 11, it had a full staff of presidential aides. In short, there was no reason that the President, sitting on Air Force One, couldn't be running the country and very effectively. The airplane was 90% functional while flying, and 100% functional had it simply landed at the nearest military base.
<p>

The presidential jet was an easy flight from at least three different facilities designed exactly for this sort of national emergency, including NORAD's underground Operations Center, FEMA's Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center in Virginia, and "Site R," a supersecret military command post near the Maryland border (described in detail by James Bamford in "A Pretext for War"). Every one of these facilities was just as effective as the White House bunker for running a war. Every one of these facilities was effectively immune to bomb and kamikaze jet attacks.
<p>

But while the Vice President was issuing extra-constitutional orders that made <a href="/library/bio/usa/alexander-haig/">Alexander Haig</a> look like a rank amateur, the President was nowhere to be found. To explore the reason for this, we must add the following entry to our chronology but qualify it extensively:
<p>

<table>
<tr><td align="right" valign="top" nowrap><tt>10:32 </tt></td><td><font size="-1"> A threat is reported against Air Force One, leading the Secret Service to insist the president not return to Washington, D.C.
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

On September 12, the claim was first made by presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer. "We have specific and credible information that the White House and Air Force One were also intended targets of these attacks."
<p>

Specific and credible? The Washington Post gave the following colorful account of the threat in a January 2002 article:
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
Cheney called Bush on Air Force One, on its way from Florida to Washington, to say the White House had just received a threat against the plane. The caller had used its code word, "Angel," suggesting terrorists had inside information. Card was told it would take between 40 minutes and 90 minutes to get a protective fighter escort up to Air Force One. 
<p>

Bush told an aide that Air Force One "is next." He was in an angry mood. "We're going to find out who did this," he said to Cheney, "and we're going to kick their asses."
<p>

Air Force One was still en route to Washington when Cheney called again at 10:41 a.m. This time, he urged Bush not to return. "There's still a threat to Washington," the vice president said. Rice agreed, and had told the president the same thing. 
<p>

There was little debate or discussion. Cheney was worried the terrorists might be trying to decapitate the government, to kill its leaders. Bush agreed. 
<p>

Within minutes, those on board the president's plane could feel it bank suddenly and sharply to the left, its course now westerly toward Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. It was within easy range, and once there food and fuel could be loaded and the president could have access to its more sophisticated communications systems. 
<p>

The threat to the plane turned out to be false. Someone inside the White House had heard a threat to Air Force One, perhaps in a phoned-in call, and passed it up the line using the code word "Angel." Others thought the threatening caller had used the code word. It took days for the incident to be sorted out and weeks before the White House publicly acknowledged it. 
</tt></blockquote>

Not only was the threat spurious, but there have been serious questions about whether the exchange described above even took place, whether Cheney might have made up the threat, or whether it was simply a hastily constructed explanation for why the president was running like a scared rabbit. <p>

Whatever the rationale, Bush was not coming back to Washington for several hours. <p>

<h2>The Aftermath</h2>

<img src="/library/crime/terrorism/september_11/911-bush-nsc.jpg" height="240" width="306" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>

The attack was over, and America was exhausted. While millions sat glued to the television set, awaiting news of the next disaster, the federal government began implementing measures to protect government institutions and civilian structures. Orders were given to evacuate tall buildings around the country, while the executive branch eventually (and ungraciously) got around to providing some protection for the legislative branch. <p>

The President spent these hours contemplating the attack. By his own account, his first reaction was a desire to get even, and just as soon as he dared set foot back in Washington, he would, by God! The nation went into lockdown, as the false alarms continued to trickle in, and shellshocked Americans would eventually fall asleep with the TV on. And that TV is still on today...

Immediately following the first attack, I implemented our government's emergency response plans. Our military is powerful, and it's prepared. Our emergency teams are working in New York City and Washington, D.C. to help with local rescue efforts.
<p>
Our first priority is to get help to those who have been injured, and to take every precaution to protect our citizens at home and around the world from further attacks.
<p>
The functions of our government continue without interruption. Federal agencies in Washington which had to be evacuated today are reopening for essential personnel tonight, and will be open for business tomorrow. Our financial institutions remain strong, and the American economy will be open for business, as well.
<p>
The search is underway for those who are behind these evil acts. I've directed the full resources of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice. We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.</tt></blockquote>
