<h1>Gloryholes</h1>
<p>Barely two months into 2004, the House Energy and Commerce Committee secured 
  a vote of 49-1, allowing the FCC to increase the maximum fine for "indecency" 
  on television or radio to an astonishing <b>one-half million dollars. </b>This 
  was swift legislation prompted by Janet Jackson's impossibly lame tit gag and 
  Clear Channel's ongoing troubles with radio personality <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/radio/howard-stern/">Howard Stern</a>. Fortunately, 
  this court decision fails to impact anyone cruising for three-dimensional adult 
  content found only <b>off</b> the dial, without any complicated infrastructure 
  required to deliver on its promise.</p>
<p><i>Gloryholes </i>are small, fist-sized apertures between <a href="/library/sex/homosexuality/cruisy-restrooms/">bathroom stalls</a> or 
  private video booths at the adult bookstore. Each is raised nearly hip-height 
  from the ground, with a circumference large enough to place a penis through. 
  Doing so allows the individual on the opposite side to perform, ostensibly, 
  some form of sexual activity.</p>
<p>Gloryholes can most commonly be located in <i>Tea Rooms</i>, which evolved 
  from the nickname<i> toilet room</i> or the abbreviated (but arguably ghetto) 
  t-room. Tea rooms are public toilet areas where clandestine homosexual activity 
  began gaining massive popularity as early as the eighteenth century. This was 
  at a time when cocksucking was hardly new or novel, and while it was was very 
  much "all the rage," gay people themselves were against the law. Men 
  caught in compromising positions with one another in grope-filled, squirt-heavy 
  sling-based activity were subjected to immediate arrest and summary public humiliation, 
  followed by lengthy jail terms and subsequent execution.</p>
<p><img src="mt-morris.jpg" width="241" height="155" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><img src="21st-sf.jpg" width="152" height="276" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Court 
  records as far back as 1860 document cases of men arrested individually and 
  <i>en masse</i> after neighbors, landlords, policemen and janitors innocently 
  peeped through something as simple as a keyhole (or kicked down doors) to ascertain 
  the exact nature of their targets' untoward antics. In an effort to avoid arrest, 
  meeting places were eventually established and spoken of in hushed, lisping 
  tones. Lovingly sketched watercolor maps, charts, and diagrams swished effortlessly 
  from hand to hand across an underground secret society of gay men singular of 
  purpose and committed to cocksucking. The list of meeting places soon grew very 
  large indeed; expanding to include public parks, alleys, dumpsters, YMCA facilities, 
  restrooms, train depots, bus stations, judicial chambers, balconies of silent 
  movie theaters, cheap hotel rooms, nightclubs, abandoned carriages, public libraries, 
  dilapidated farmhouses, hectare-sized fields of gently swaying barley, or sturdy, 
  towering cornstalks where on summer afternoons most anyone of sound mind might 
  conceivably find themselves "lost".</p>
<p>These facilities blossomed in the 1950s. Gay bath houses authoritatively dotted 
  the American landscape with such frequency, confidence and availability you'd 
  swear any one of them was a Starbucks. To say that some even had wall-to-wall 
  linoleum would be an understatement. This was the atomic age after all, where 
  the science of sucking dick meant serious business opportunities and <i>serious</i> 
  profit. These were not penny-ante dicklicking warehouses, but proper, three-story 
  hotels often located on coveted real estate in the center of a bustling, downtown 
  metropolis. They would have offered free wireless Internet access had it been 
  available.</p>
<p><img src="bbfree1.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">One 
  of the most important developments in the history of gay bath houses involved 
  gay management and ownership. In 1965, after being so impressed with the endless 
  pic-a-nic basketlike smorgasbord of "amenities" offered in San Francisco, 
  businessman Jack Campbell and two partners opened the <i>Club Bath</i> chain 
  which offered a "a better, cleaner atmosphere" in Cleveland, Ohio. 
  Homosexuals could enjoy television rooms, vending machines, Jacuzzis, shag carpeting 
  and wood paneling -- just like in those banned Calvin Klein advertisements.</p>
<p>By 1971 their business included fourteen bathhouses across the United States, 
  offering student discounts and special rates for men who arrived in pairs on 
  Buddy Nights. In 1973, the <i>Club</i> baths had almost 500,000 card-carrying 
  members. There was so much business to go around that "competition" 
  was hardly a problem. Large cities could easily support two or three bathhouses, 
  each of which had hundreds of customers a week renting a locker or a room for 
  the night. In fact, thousands of men chose an evening of "tubs" over 
  going to bars or the corner disco. At that time, 54 percent of gay men had visited 
  the baths more than once in their lives, and 20 percent could described their 
  visits as "somewhat" or "very" frequent. Recruitment advertisements 
  boasted: "If your membership doesn't offer you 1400 rooms, on 64 floors, 
  with 30 steam rooms, 25 saunas, 24 whirlpools, and 8 swimming pools, then you 
  haven't got THE CARD."</p>
<p><img src="clubSF2.jpg" width="209" height="329" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><img src="liberty-snack.jpg" width="175" height="268" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">But 
  these oases of cocksucking camaraderie were subject to vice raid, nice and regular. 
  Not everyone followed the rules, and bath house owners routinely proved themselves 
  prone not only to periodical knobslobbery, but vicious unmitigated backstabbery 
  to boot. Facilities which enjoyed increased profits then had to <i>prevent</i> 
  their venues from becoming too popular. They'd hire bouncers, private guards 
  -- or call the police themselves just to empty the joint and ensure rapid turnover. 
  One account pointed to the fat tips a bath house manager could receive on a 
  single evening, provided a portion of his bonus went toward paying off any cops 
  who "happened" to show up. And the cops? They got free blowjobs, took 
  everyone's money and busted 'em all up anyways. It was an elegantly choreographed 
  Scorsese montage, only with gay dicks instead of casinos.</p>
<p>The <i>Hothouse,</i> San Francisco's legendary four-story, ten-thousand-square-foot 
  bath house devoted to forms of sexual expression like bondage, water sports, 
  fisting and "scat," shut down in the wake of mounting concerns over 
  the spread of disease. The city's last bath house, the <i>21st Street Baths,</i> 
  closed its doors for good in 1987. Ting-a-ling-a-ling.</p>
<p><img src="film2.jpg" width="94" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Meanwhile, 
  halfway across town at the <b>tittie bar,</b> straight guys were getting handjobs 
  with no problem. And blowjobs! Not to mention regular sexual encounters and 
  god only <i>knows</i> what else -- from lap dancers, pole vaulters, strippers, 
  would-be strippers, and doe-eyed strippers in training. To the gay bath house 
  crowd, this hardly seemed fair. Whatever happened to the separation of church 
  and state? Those who might ordinarily cry out for stall walls to be torn down 
  now found themselves devising new ways of erecting them, even punching holes 
  through them. Craftily, in one of the earliest documented attempts at cannibalizing 
  or otherwise "taking back" an aspect of their own culture, the gay 
  bath house crowd quietly moved their whole operation straight into the center 
  of the firestorm:<b> the adult bookstore.</b></p>
<p><b>Buddy booths</b> were invented: closet-sized stalls where a single wall, 
  or glass partition with dual curtains -- or any apparatus blocking access to 
  your neighbor -- separates two booths. </p>
<p>A pushbutton on either side first raises, then lowers one's partition. When 
  two buttons are pressed by adjacent parties, both curtains rise and the two 
  individuals can access one another. <img src="arcade.jpg" width="400" height="308" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Some 
  booths require both buttons to be pressed at the same time. These booths were 
  designed to allow people to <i>see,</i> but not necessarily touch their neighbor. 
  Some facilities have modified their booths so that only a small porthole opens 
  up. This allows two people to see <i>and</i> feel each other while adhering 
  to the age-old principle of good fences making for good neighbors. A <i>couples' 
  booth</i> is not unlike the TARDIS, an inner sanctum appearing much larger on 
  the inside than on the out. Often a wooden sauna bench takes the place of a 
  single swivel stool or compact folding chair, and such booths are suitable for 
  double dates.</p>
<p>But the times would turn yet again. The straight men (and traditional porn 
  enthusiasts) who didn't particularly care for the gay bath constituent invading 
  their personal beat-off space took drastic measures to reclaim what they believed 
  was the only <b>correct</b> stance on closeted, semi-sanctioned cocksucking 
  in public. A line of adult magazines, videos and DVDs blatantly titled <i>GLORYHOLE</i> 
  puts a twentieth-century, decidedly heterosexual spin on the stall-to-stall 
  craze sweeping the nation. It's "not just for fags anymore," proclaims 
  competing press kits. In the content, women and young girls -- not just bearish 
  men in wigs -- are seen getting down on their hands and knees in bathroom stalls, 
  buddy booths, or subway station toilets. Each female affords quality customer 
  care to any erection rapping soundly at her chamber door. At times these partitions 
  are evenly equipped with <i>multiple</i> gloryholes: as the young ladies service 
  three or four gentlemen callers at once, they begin to resemble old fashioned 
  telephone operators at a busy pegboard switching terminal. Furthering exacerbating 
  both controversy and visual incongruency, all the cocks presented in the <i>GLORYHOLE</i> 
  series are enormous African-American cocks.</p>

<p>Increasingly, more important than knowing <i>where</i> to find gloryholes is 
  knowing how to avoid holes gathering nothing but trouble. The secret handpainted 
  treasure maps passed down from one ruffled fop to another have given way to 
  advanced Internet-based bulletin boarding technology and instant messaging, 
  upon which seasoned world travelers dispense procedural advice, personalized 
  anecdotal evidence, and dire warnings to be heeded by anyone in a position to 
  listen and learn:</p>
<p><b>DeAnza 
  Community College,</b> Steven's Creek Blvd., Cupertino, CA: <i>"Cruisy 
  toilet next to football stadium bleachers. The campus police appear to 
  be watching traffic going in and out on occasion."</i><br>
  <br>
  <b>VCO Adult Video,</b> Mountain View, CA: <i>"I was there last night and 
  I saw cops at the back. This is a very dangerous place that I will not return 
  to. Also the old man is so nasty, he threatens to call the cops every time he 
  sees you standing in front of the video display."</i></p>
<p><b>Macy's Union Square, </b>San Francisco, CA:<i> "Security comes in and 
  out several times a day and hangs out where you can't see them. I've witnessed 
  this several times, and have also seen a couple people busted."</i></p>
<p><b>The Vault,</b> Provincetown, MA:<i> "This place sucks! You might as 
  well be in some straight bar. There is no action at all and it’s way too 
  bright."</i></p>
<p><b>Blue Hills Reservation,</b> MA:<i> "I was here recently and was stopped 
  by an undercover "police officer” who fondled himself only to get 
  me to touch him back. After he threatened to arrest me, he said we could work 
  out a deal 
  if I paid him $300. I was panic stricken and we then drove in my car to a nearby 
  ATM and I gave him $100 to get my license back. I drove him back to the woods 
  and left. I wonder if it was a scam."</i></p>
<p><b>Cinema Blue Theatre,</b> Alabama: <i>"There was a police bust here 
  today. Five undercover cops paid and came in at different times. Some lurked 
  outside looking at magazines. After watching some guys jacking awhile, they 
  flashed on the lights, the cops outside ran in and took about seven people away, 
  after making a disgusting public lecture to everyone in theater. Be careful 
  and never pull your dick out unless you’re alone with someone in an empty 
  theater."</i></p>
<p><b>Silverwater Road, </b>Sydney Australia: <i>"It’s a great spot. 
  Watch out for the cops. They used to only drive through the car park, but now 
  are actually checking the toilets."</i><br>
  <br>
  <b>Hester Park,</b> London:<i> "Four guys were attacked, tied up, assaulted, 
  and their wallets etc. stolen, and the offenders made the guys give their pin 
  numbers to rob their accounts. Coverage was extensive on the news."</i></p>
<p><b>Warehouse Spa For Men,</b> Hamilton, Ontario: <i>"I was there on a 
  Saturday night and only three other guys were there, all over fifty and over 
  three hundred pounds. I've been here about seven times, and always ended up 
  going home to jack off."</i></p>
<p><b>Victoria 
  Station, Manchester:</b> <i>"I was having the best fuck of my life here. 
  As soon as we finished, a policeman come in. If he had been any earlier he would 
  have caught me bent over the urinal getting fucked stupid."</i></p>
<p>Not every gloryhole station is lucky enough to boast a buddy booth. Many facilities 
  tolerate two or more individuals <i>sharing</i> a designated space discreetly, 
  but doing so requires either party to broadcast clear indicators such as the 
  common invitational protocol many cocksuckers refer to as <b>eye contact.</b></p>
<p>As you enter the facility, maintain a direct and steady gaze for more than 
  a few seconds with your intended partner. If he returns the stare, go into the 
  booth and leave the door unlocked. If he is <i>also</i> interested, he will 
  open your door shortly thereafter. If he is <b>not</b> interested, he will likely 
  break any glance in your direction the moment your eyes meet his.</p>
<p>The 
  <b>bathroom stall</b> is the only major anonymous sex stop on or near interstate 
  highways, and the protocol is even simpler. Enter the stall at the farthest 
  end of the bathroom. Close the door, pull your pants down and wait. When someone 
  enters the stall next to you, move and tap your foot in such a way that your 
  neighbor can see and hear. Toilet cruisers frequent isolated bathrooms far from 
  the public view, and often listen for squeaky doors. There are, undoubtedly, 
  FAQs.</p>
<p>"What if I'm at a truck stop restroom in southern Wyoming," writes 
  one anonymous user, "and some ignorant homophobe grabs my cock, bends it 
  in half, pounds a huge nail through it and takes off? I'd be stuck in the middle 
  of nowhere! How in the world would I extricate myself from such a predicament? 
  And how might I delicately explain such a farcical <i>Three's Company </i>episode 
  to say, my prudish wife and three yappy teenage sons outside in the minivan? 
  They've been patiently waiting for me to emerge from the restroom 
  so we can continue our vacation. I'm posting this msg from my cel phone. nobodys 
  enterd the bathr0m yet so i'm ok but if some1 cud plz respnd i hurt bad k thx."</p>
<p><i>Blood Simple</i> and <i>Passion of the Christ</i> references aside, the 
  overwhelming consensus is that you could simply drill another gloryhole through 
  the stall partition, one large enough to slip your free hand through. From there, 
  with the precision of a master surgeon, you could remove the offending nail 
  inch by inch from your cock as quickly as time permitted. Sanitary tissue, hand 
  towels, and cowboy hat-shaped toilet seat covers are excellent impromptu bandages 
  which do indeed stem the flow of blood -- but scatterbrained paranoias like 
  these are largely the stuff of urban legend, fueled by superstitious fears: 
  marauding vice cops equipped with miniature, penis-sized handcuffs suitable 
  for clamping around surprised erections are (in most states) the legacy of a 
  bygone era. In any event, gloryhole enthusiasts are always encouraged to stay 
  alert for unexpected hazards. Second only to the itchy red welts caused by sexually 
  transmitted diseases or the night tremors and facial wasting prompted by AIDS-related 
  symptoms, the largest obstacles to wrangle during acts of free range cocksucking 
  are the <b>standards of decency in your community.</b></p>

  <p>The American Civil Liberties Union has engineered a wallet-sized pop-up book 
  applicable to all citizens of the United States. This handy guide is suitable 
  for carriage in your wallet, back pocket or glove compartment. It describes 
  in step-by-step detail how any one of us should respond when we're stopped by 
  police, or when we encounter law enforcement officials intent upon investigating 
  our potential involvement with nearby criminal activity. It also details our 
  rights, our legal obligations, things we 
  can do, things we absolutely must not do, and it talks about police procedures 
  like <i>pocket patting</i> and search warrants, which we don't necessarily have 
  to subject ourselves to. Click <a href="aclu.gif">here</a> to view a copy of this document 
  in another big huge window. Keep in mind, this document was engineered prior 
  to the Patriot Act.</p>
<p>The <b>Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund</b> is a branch of <b>Lambda Legal,</b> 
  a nationwide organization committed to achieving nothing less than the full 
  recognition of civil rights for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, the transgendered, 
  and people with HIV/AIDS. "Please do not confuse Lambda with <a href="/library/sex/homosexuality/pederasty/">NAMBLA</a>," 
  they're quick to prompt. "They're completely different."</p>
<p><img src="bustcard.gif" width="200" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Lambda 
  also represents the unsung heroes of the night: those lurking in the pumpkin 
  patch, crouching behind freshly clipped elderberry bushes -- even those with 
  outmoded beige trench coats buckled at the knees sitting patiently in the shadows 
  of a handicapped stall waiting for the inevitable multicolored, multicultural 
  cock to poke itself through the suspiciously cushioned and well-maintained aperture. 
  While <b>full-blown cock addiction</b> is neither a word nor phrase meant for 
  bandying about lightly -- those lurking, whether they know it or not, seek nothing 
  less than equal status to those among us who <b>are</b> fully blown on a regular 
  basis.</p>
<p>Some have gone so far as to declare these mysterious midnight smokers and pokers 
  nothing short of magically delicious. Toward that end, the social architects 
  at Lambda Legal have authored yet <i>another</i> fold 'em up, spread 'em out 
  pop-up book suitable for toting about town in a purse or on your person.</p>
<p>IF YOU CRUISE IN PARKS, BATHROOMS OR OTHER SPACES OPEN TO PUBLIC VIEW, shrieks 
  the tasteful Helvetica twelve point on page one, BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS 
  AND KNOW YOUR RIGHTS.</p>
<p>It's called the <i>Little Black Book</i>, drafted specifically for cocksuckers 
  <i>and</i> cockseekers alike. <a href="black.gif">Click here</a> for a free copy -- 
  and don't call it a parody. The dick you lick belongs to someone else, but the 
  ass you save might be your own.</p></p>
