<p class=MsoTitle>The CIA & LSD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What follows is a chapter from Martin Lee and Bruce Shlain’s
book, Acid Dreams_. The book is a terrific read. The following selection is
chapter 1, which examines the development of the CIA’s interest in the
mysterious new drug, LSD. It is alternately funny, disgusting, and horrific.  Lemme
give you a preview of what follows.  At first, the CIA thought LSD would make
them virtual masters of the universe. Later, after sober second thought, they
realized they might have to set their sights little lower, but they continued
their enthusiasm for the drug (which Richard Helms called “dynamite”).  The CIA
realized that an adversary intelligence service could employ LSD “to produce
anxiety or terror in medically unsophisticated subjects unable to distinguish
drug-induced psychosis from actual insanity”. The only way to be sure that an
operative would not freak out under such circumstances would be to give him a
taste of LSD (a mind control vaccine?) before he was sent on a sensitive
overseas mission. Such a person would know that the effects of the drug were
transitory and would therefore be in a better position to handle the
experience. CIA documents actually refer to agents who were familiar with LSD
as “enlightened operatives”. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At one point, CIA employees were running around,
dosing themselves and their buddies in acid to either “immunize” themselves to
its effects, or just test its limits. This part makes amusing reading—to borrow
the hackneyed phrase: truth is stranger than fiction. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Finally, someone had to clamp down on the CIA’s LSD
consumption. One of my favorite passages quotes a security memo (dated Dec. 15, 1954) dealing with a rumored proposal to “spike” the annual CIA Christmas party
punch with acid.  The writer of this memo concluded indignantly and
unequivocally that he did “not recommend [LSD] testing in the Christmas punch
bowls usually present at the Christmas office parties”.  CIA was consumed with
interest in developing the perfect drug for every emotion/intellectual brain
reaction. Dial-a-brain drugs.  What’s more, according to a document dated May 5, 1955, the CIA placed a high priority on the development of a drug “which will
produce ‘pure euphoria’ with no subsequent letdown”.  (I think I might place a
“high priority” on such a thing myself...) </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>All this interest led to extravagant CIA funding of
LSD research everywhere—including a soon-to-be famous fellow named Timothy
Leary.  The rest, as they say, is history. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i>ACID DREAMS</i> The CIA, LSD and the Sixties
Rebellion Martin A Lee and Bruce Shlain Grove Press, New York: 1985 ISBN
0-394-55013-7 chapter 1 IN THE BEGINNING THERE WAS MADNESS... </p>

<h1>The Truth Seekers </h1>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the spring of 1942, General William “Wild Bill”
Donovan, chief of the OSS, the CIA’s wartime predecessor, assembled a
half-dozen prestigious American scientists and asked them to undertake a
top-secret research program. Their mission, Donovan explained, was to develop a
speech-inducing drug for use in intelligence interrogations. He insisted that the
need for such a weapon was so acute as to warrant any and every attempt to find
it. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The use of drugs by secret agents had long been a
part of cloak-and-dagger folklore, but this would be the first concerted
attempt on the part of an American espionage organization to modify human
behavior through chemical means. “We were not afraid to try things that had
never been done before,” asserted Donovan, who was known for his freewheeling
and unconventional approach to the spy trade. The OSS chief pressed his associates
to come up with a substance that could break down the psychological defenses of
enemy spies and POWs, thereby causing an uninhibited disclosure of classified
information. Such a drug would also be useful for screening OSS personnel in
order to identify German sympathizers, double-agents, and potential misfits. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Dr Windfred Overhulser, superintendent of Saint
Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, DC, was appointed chairman of the research
committee.  Other members included Dr Edward Strecker (then president of the
American Psychiatric Association) and Harry J Anslinger (head of the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics). The committee surveyed and rejected numerous
drugs—including alcohol, barbituates, and caffeine. Peyote and scopolamine were
also tested, but the visions produced by these substances interfered with the
interrogation process. Eventually, marijuana was chosen as the most likely
candidate for a speech-inducing agent. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>OSS scientists created a highly-potent extract of
cannabis and, through a process known as esterification, a clear and viscous
liquid was obtained. The final product had no color, odor, or taste. It would
be nearly impossible to detect when administered surreptitiously—which is
exactly what the spies intended to do. “There is no reason to believe that any
other nation or group is familiar with the preparation of this particular
drug,” stated one classified OSS document. Henceforth, the OSS referred to the
marijuana extract as “TD”—a rather transparent cover for “Truth Drug”. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Various ways of administering TD were tried upon
witting and unwitting subjects. OSS operatives found that the medicated goo
could “be injected into any type of food, such as mashed potatoes, butter,
salad dressing, or in such things as candy.” Another scheme relied on using
facial tissues impregnated with the drug. But these methods had drawbacks. What
if someone had a particularly ravenous appetite? Too much TD could knock a
subject out and render him useless for interrogation. The OSS eventually
determined that the best approach involved the use of a hypodermic syringe to
inject a diluted TD solution into a cigarette or cigar. After smoking such an
item, the subject would get suitably stoned, at which point a skillful
interrogator would move in and try to get him to spill the beans. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The effects of TD were described in an OSS report: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“TD appears to relax all inhibitions and to deaden
the areas of the brain which govern an individual’s discretion and caution. It
accentuates the senses and makes manifest any strong characteristics of the
individual. Sexual inhibitions are lowered, and the sense of humor is
accentuated to the point where any statement or situation can become extremely
funny to the subject. On the other hand, a person’s unpleasant characteristics
may also be heightened. It may be stated that, generally speaking, the reaction
will be one of great loquacity and hilarity.” (This was a rather mild and
playful assessment of the effects of marijuana compared to the public rantings
of Harry Anslinger, the narcotics chief, who orchestrated an unrelenting media
campaign against “the killer weed”.) </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>After testing TD on themselves, their associates,
and US military personnel, OSS agents utilized the drug operationally, although
on a limited basis.  The results were mixed. In certain circumstances, TD
subjects felt a driving necessity “to discuss psychologically-charged topics.
Whatever the individual is trying to withhold will be forced to the top of his
subconscious mind.” But there were also those who experienced “toxic
reactions”—better known in latter-day lingo as “bummers”. One unwitting doper
became irritable and threatening and complained of feeling like he was “two
different people”. The peculiar nature of his symptoms precluded any attempt to
question him.  That was how it went, from one extreme to the other. At times,
TD seemed to stimulate “a rush of talk”; on other occasions, people got
paranoid and didn’t say a word. The lack of consistency proved to be a major
stumbling block and “Donovan’s dreamers”—as his enthusiastic OSS staffers have
been called—reluctantly weaned themselves from their reefer madness. A
handwritten comment in the margins of an OSS document summed up their stoned
escapades: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“The drug defies all but the most expert and
searching analysis and, for all practical purposes, can be considered beyond
analysis.” After the war, the CIA and the military picked-up where they OSS had
left off in the secret search for a truth serum. The navy took the lead when it
initiated Project CHATTER in 1947 -- the same year the CIA was formed.
Described as an “offensive” program, CHATTER was supposed to devise means of
obtaining information from people independent of their volition but without
physical duress. Toward this end, Dr Charles Savage conducted experiments with
mescaline (a semi-synthetic extract of the peyote cactus that produces
hallucinations similar to those caused by LSD) at the Naval Medical Research
Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. But these studies, which involved animal as
well as human subjects, did not yield as effective truth serum, and CHATTER was
terminated in 1953.  The navy became interested in mescaline as an
interrogation agent when American investigators learned of mind control
experiments carried out by Nazi doctors at the Dachau concentration camp during
World War II. After administering the hallucinogen to 30 prisoners, the Nazis
concluded that it was “impossible to impose one’s will on another person as in
hypnosis even when the strongest dose of mescaline had been given.” But the drug
still afforded certain advantages to SS interrogators, who were consistently
able to draw “even the most intimate secrets from the [subject] when questions
where cleverly put.” Not surprisingly, “sentiments of hatred and revenge were
exposed in every case.” The mescaline experiments at Dachau were described in a
lengthy report by the US Naval Technical Mission, which swept across Europe in
search of every scrap of industrial material and scientific data that could be
garnered from the fallen Reich.  This mission set the stage for the wholesale
importation of more than 600 top Nazi scientists under the auspices of Project
paperclip—which the CIA supervised during the early years of the Cold War.
Among those who emigrated to the US in such a fashion was Dr Hubertus Strughold,
the German scientist whose chief subordinates (Dr Sigmund Ruff and Dr Sigmund Rascher)
were directly involved in “aviation medicine” experiments at Dachau, which
included the mescaline studies.  Despite recurring allegations that he sanctioned
medical atrocities during the war, Strughold settled in Texas and became an
important figure in America’s space program. After Werner von Braun, he was the
top Nazi scientist employed by the American government, and he was subsequently
hailed by NASA as the “father of space medicine”.  The CIA, meanwhile, had
launched an intensive research effort geared toward developing “special”
interrogation techniques. Two methods showed promise in the late 1940s. The
first involved narcohypnosis—in which a CIA psychiatrist attempted to induce a
trance state after administering a mild sedative. A second technique involved a
combination of two different drugs with contradictory effects. A heavy dose of barbituates
was given to knock the subject out, and then he received an injection of a
stimulant, usually some type of amphetamine. As he started to come out of a
somnambulant state, he would reach a certain ineffable point prior to becoming
fully conscious.  Described in CIA documents as “the twilight zone”, this groggy
condition was considered optimal for interrogation. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>CIA doctors attempted to extend the stuporous limbo
as long as possible. In order to maintain the delicate balance between
consciousness and unconsciousness, an intravenous hookup was inserted in both
the subject’s arms. One set of works contained a downer, the other an upper
(the classic “goofball” effect), with a mere flick of the finger an
interrogator could regulate the flow of chemicals. The idea was to produce a
“push”—a sudden outpouring of thoughts, emotions, confidences, and whatnot.
Along this line, various combinations were tested. Seconal and Dexedrine; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Pentothal and Desoxyn; and depending on the whim of
the spy in charge,some marijuana (the old OSS stand-by, which the CIA referred
to as “sugar”) might be thrown in for good measure.  The goofball approach was
not a precision science.  There were no strictly prescribed rules or operating
procedures regarding what drugs should be employed in a given situation. The
CIA interrogators were left to their own devices, and a certain degree of
recklessness was perhaps inevitable. In one case, a group of CIA experts
hastily drafted a memo after reviewing a report prepared by one of the Agency’s
special interrogation teams. The medical consultants pointed out that “the
amounts of scopolamine administered were extremely heavy.” They also noted that
the best results were obtained when two or at most three different chemicals
were used in a session. In this case, however, heavy doses of scopolamine were
administered along with thiamine, sodium luminal, atropine sulfate, sodium
pentothal and caffeine sulfate. One of the CIA’s professional consultants in
“H” techniques also questioned why hypnosis was attempted “after a long and
continuous use of chemicals, after the subject had vomited, and after
apparently a maximum tolerance point had been reached with the chemicals.”
Everyone who read the interrogation report agreed that hypnosis was useless, if
not impossible, under such conditions. Nevertheless, the memo concluded by
reaffirming that “no criticism is intended whatsoever” and that “the choice of
operating weapons” must be left to the agents in the field. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Despite the potential hazards and tenuousness of the
procedure as a whole, special interrogations were strongly endorsed by Agency
officials. A CIA document dated November 26, 1951, announced: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“We’re now convinced that we can maintain a subject
in a controlled state for a much longer period of time that we heretofore had
believed possible. Furthermore, we feel that by use of certain chemicals or
combinations, we can, in a very high percentage of cases, produce relevant
information.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Although these techniques were still considered
experimental, the prevailing opinion among members of the special interrogation
teams was that there had been enough experiments “to justify giving the green
light to operational use of the techniques.” “There will be many a failure,” a
CIA scientist acknowledged, but he was quick to stress that “very success with
this method will be pure gravy.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In an effort to expand its research program, the CIA
contacted academics and other outside experts who specialized in areas of
mutual interest.  Liaison was established with the research sections of police
departments and criminology laboratories; medical practitioners, professional
hypnotists, and psychiatrists were brought on as paid consultants, and various
branches of the military provided assistance. Oftentimes, these arrangements
involved a cover to conceal the CIA’s interest in behavior modification. With
the bureaucratic apparatus already in place, the CIA’s mind control efforts
were integrated into a single project under the codename BLUEBIRD. Due to the
extreme sensitivity of the project, the usual channels for authorization were
bypassed—instead of going through the Projects Review Committee, the proposal
for BLUEBIRD was submitted directly to CIA director Roscoe Hillenkoetter, who
authorized the use of unvouchered funds to finance the hush-hush undertaking.
With this seal of approval, the CIA’s first major drug-testing program was
officially launched. BLUEBIRD was to remained a carefully guarded secret, for
if word of the program leaked out, it would have been a great embarrassment and
a detriment to American intelligence. As one CIA document put it, BLUEBIRD
material was “not fit for public consumption.” From the outset, the CIA’s mind
control program had an explicit domestic angle. A memo dated July 13, 1951, described the Agency’s mind-bending efforts as “broad and comprehensive,
involving both domestic and overseas activities, and taking into consideration
the programs and objectives of other departments, principally the military
services.” BLUEBIRD activities were designed to create as “exploitable
alteration of personality” in selected individuals; specific targets included
“potential agents, defectors, refugees, POWs,” and a vague category of
“others.” A number of units within the CIA participated in this endeavor,
including the Inspection and Security Staff (the forerunner of the Office of
Security), which assumed overall responsibility for running the program and
dispatching the special interrogation teams. Colonel Sheffield Edwards, the
chairman of the BLUEBIRD steering committee, consistently pushed for a more
reliable speech-inducing substance. By the time BLUEBIRD evolved into Operation
ARTICHOKE (the formal change in codenames occurred August 1951), Security
officials were still searching for the magic technique—the deus ex machina—that
would guarantee surefire results. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The whole concept of a truth drug was a bit
farfetched to begin with. It presupposed that there was a way to chemically
bypass the mind’s censor and turn the psyche inside out, unleashing a profusion
of buried secrets, and that surely some approximation of “truth” would emerge
amidst all the personal debris. In this respect the CIA’s quest resembled a
skewed version of a familiar mythological theme from which such images as the
Philosopher’s Stone and the Fountain of Youth derive—that through touching or
ingesting something one can acquire wisdom, immortality, or eternal peace. It
is more than a bit ironic that the biblical inscription on the marble wall of
the main lobby at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, reads, “And ye shall
know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free”.  The freewheeling atmosphere
that prevailed during the CIA’s early years encouraged an “anything goes”
attitude among researchers associated with the mind control program. This was
before the Agency’s bureaucratic arteries began to harden, and those who
participated on Operation ARTICHOKE were intent on leaving no stone unturned in
an effort to deliver the ultimate truth drug. A number of agents were sent on
fact-finding missions to all corners of the globe to procure samples of rare
herbs and botanicals. The results of one such trip were recorded in a heavily
deleted document entitled “Exploration of Potential Plant Resources in the Caribbean
Region”. Among the numerous items mentioned in this report, a few were
particularly intriguing. A plant called a “stupid bush”, characterized by the
CIA as a psychogenic agent and a pernicious weed, was said to proliferate in Puerto
 Rico and Saint Thomas. Its effects were shrouded in mystery. An “information
bush” was also discovered. This shrub stumped CIA experts, who were at a loss
to pin down its properties. The “information bush” was listed as a psychogenic
agent followed by a lingering question mark. What type of information --
prophetic or mundane—might be evoked by this unusual herb was unclear. Nor was
it known whether the “information bush” could be used as an antidote to the
“stupid bush” or vice versa. [grin grin grin] </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The CIA studied a veritable pharmacopoeia of drugs
with the hope of achieving a breakthrough. At one point during the early 1950s
Uncle Sam’s secret agents viewed cocaine as a potential truth serum. 
“Cocaine’s general effects have been somewhat neglected”, noted an astute
researcher. Whereupon tests were conducted that enabled the CIA to determine
that the precious powder “will produce elation, talkativeness, etc.” when
administer by injection. “Larger doses,” according to a previously classified
document, “may cause fearfulness and alarming hallucinations.” The document
goes on to report that cocaine “counteracts... the catatonia of catatonic
schizophrenics” and concludes with the recommendation that the drug be studied
further.  A number of cocaine derivatives were also investigated from an
interrogation standpoint.  Procaine, a synthetic analogue, was tested on mental
patients and the results were intriguing.  When injected into the frontal lobe
of the brain through trephine holes in the skull, the drug “produced free and
spontaneous speech within two days in mute schizophrenics”. This procedure was
rejected as “too surgical for our use”.  Nevertheless, according to a CIA
pharmacologist, “it is possible that such a drug could be gotten into the
general circulation of subject without surgery, hypodermic or feeding.” He
suggested a method known as iontophoresis, which involves using an electric
current to transfer the ions of a chosen medicament into the tissues of the
body.  The CIA’s infatuation with cocaine was short-lived. It may have titilated
the nostrils of more than a few spies and produced some heady speculation, but
after the initial inspiration it was back to square one. Perhaps their
expectations were too high for any drug to accommodate. Or maybe a new approach
to the problem was required.  The search for an effective interrogation
technique eventually led to heroin. Not the heroin that ex-Nazi pilots under
CIA contract smuggled out of the Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia on CIA
proprietary airlines during the late 1940s and 1950s; nor the heroin that was
pumped into America’s black and brown ghettos after passing through contraband
networks controlled by mobsters who moonlighted as CIA hitmen. The Agency’s
involvement in worldwide heroin traffic, which has been well documented in _The
Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia_ by Alfred McCoy, went far beyond the
scope of Operation ARTICHOKE, which was primarily concerned with eliciting
information from recalcitrant subjects. However, ARTICHOKE scientists did see
possible advantages in heroin as a mind control drug. According to a CIA
document dated April 26, 1952, heroin was “frequently used by police and
intelligence officers <i>on a routine basis</i> [emphasis added]”.  The cold
turkey theory of interrogation: CIA operatives determined that heroin and other
habit-forming substances “can be useful in reverse because of the stresses
produced when they are withdrawn from those who are addicted to their use”. </p>

<h1>Enter LSD </h1>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It was with the hope of finding the long-sought
miracle drug that CIA investigators first began to dabble with LSD-25 in the
early 1950s. At the time very little was known about the hallucinogen, even in
scientific circles. Dr Werner Stoll, the son of Sandoz president Arthur Stoll
and a colleague of Albert Hoffmann’s, was the first person to investigate the
psychological properties of LSD.  The results of his study were presented in
the <i>Swiss Archives of Neurology</i> in 1947. Stoll reported that LSD
produced disturbances in perception, hallucinations, and acceleration in
thinking; moreover, the drug was found to blunt the usual suspiciousness of
schizophrenic patients. No favorable aftereffects were described. Two years
later in the same journal Stoll contributed a second report entitled “A New
Hallucinatory Agent, Active in Very Small Amounts”. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The fact that LSD caused hallucinations should not
have been a total surprise to the scientific community. Sandoz first became
interested in ergot, the natural source of all lysergic acid.  The rye fungus
had a mysterious and contradictory reputation. In China and parts of the Mideast
it was thought to possess medicinal qualities, and certain scholars believe
that it may have been used in sacred rites in ancient Greece. In other parts of
 Europe, however, the same fungus was associated with the horrible malady known
as St Anthony’s Fire, which struck periodically like the plague. Medieval
chronicles tell of villages and towns where nearly everyone went mad for a few
days after ergot-diseased rye was unknowingly milled into flour and baked as
bread. Men were afflicted with gangrenous limbs that looked like blackened
stumps, and pregnant women miscarried.  Even in modern times, there have been
reports of ergot-related epidemics. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>FOOTNOTE: In 1951 hundreds of respectable citizens
in Pont-Saint-Esprit, a small French village, went completely berserk one
evening. Some of the town’s leading citizens jumped from windows into the Rhone.
Others ran through the streets screaming abut being chased by lions, tigers,
and “bandits with donkey ears”. Many died, and whose who survived suffered
strange aftereffects for weeks.  In his book <i>The Day of St Anthony’s Fire</i>,
John C Fuller attributes this bizarre outbreak to rye flour contaminated with
ergot.  The CIA inherited this ambiguous legacy when it embraced LSD as a mind
control drug. An ARTICHOKE document dated October 21, 1951, indicates that acid was tested initially as part of a pilot study of the effects of various
chemicals “on the conscious suppression of experimental or non-threat secrets”.
In addition to lysergic acid this particular survey covered a wide range of
substances, including morphine, ether, Benzedrine, ethyl alcohol, and
mescaline. “There is no question,” noted the author of this report, “that drugs
are already on hand (and new ones are being produced) that can destroy
integrity and make indiscreet the most dependable individual.” The report
concluded by recommending that LSD be critically tested “under threat
conditions beyond the scope of civilian experimentation”. POWs, federal
prisoners, and Security officers were mentioned as possible candidates for
these field experiments. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In another study designed to ascertain optimal
dosage levels for interrogation sessions, a CIA psychiatrist administered LSD
to “at least 12 human subjects <i>of not too high mentality</i>”. At the outset
the subjects were “told only that a new drug was being tested and promised that
nothing serious or dangerous would happen to them....  During the intoxication
they realized something was happening, but were never told exactly what.” A
dosage range of 100 to 150 micrograms was finally selected, and the Agency
proceeded to test the drug in mock interrogation trials.  Initial reports
seemed promising. In one instance LSD was given to an officer who had been
instructed not to reveal “a significant military secret”. When questioned,
however, “he gave all the details of the secret... and after the effects of the
LSD had worn off, the officer had no knowledge of revealing the information
(complete amnesia).” Favorable reports kept coming in, and when this phase of
experimentation was completed, the CIA’s Office of Scientific Intelligence
(OSI) prepared a lengthy memorandum entitled “Potential New Agent for
Unconventional Warfare”. LSD was said to be useful “for eliciting true and
accurate statements from subjects under its influence during interrogation”.
Moreover, the data on hand suggested that LSD might help in reviving memories
of past experiences. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It almost seemed to good to be true—a drug that
unearthed secrets buried deep in the unconscious mind but also caused amnesia
during the effective period. The implications were downright astounding. Soon
the entire CIA hierarchy was head over heels as news of what appeared to be a
major breakthrough sent shock waves rippling through headquarters. (C.P.Snow
once said, “The euphoria of secrecy goes to the head.”) For years they had
searched, and now they were on the verge of finding the Holy Grail of the
cloak-and-dagger trade. As one CIA officer recalled, “We had thought at first
this was the secret that was going to unlock the universe.” But the sense of
elation did not last long. As the secret research progressed, the CIA ran into
problems. Eventually they came to recognize that LSD was not really a truth
serum in the classical sense. Accurate information could not always be obtained
from people under the influence of LSD because it induced a “marked anxiety and
loss of reality contact”. Those who received unwitting doses experienced an
intense distortion of time, place, and body image, frequently culminating in
full-blown paranoid reactions. The bizarre hallucinations caused by the drug
often proved more of a hindrance than an aid to the interrogation process.
There was always the risk, for example, that an enemy spy who started to trip
out would realize he’d been drugged. This could make him overly suspicious and
taciturn to the point of clammy up entirely.  There were other pitfalls that
made the situation even more precarious from an interrogation standpoint. While
anxiety was the predominant characteristic displayed during LSD sessions, some
people experienced delusions of grandeur and omnipotence. An entire operation
might backfire if someone had an ecstatic or transcendental experience and
became convinced that he could defy his interrogators indefinitely. And then
there was the question of amnesia, which was not as cut-and-dried as first
supposed. Everyone agreed that a person would probably have a difficult time
recalling exactly what happened while he was high on LSD, but that didn’t mean
his mind would be completely blank. While the drug might distort memory to some
degree, it did not destroy it.  When CIA scientists tested a drug for
speech-inducing purposes and found that it didn’t work, they usually put it
aside and tried something else. But such was not the case with LSD. Although
early reports proved overoptimistic, the Agency was not about the discard such
a powerful and unusual substance simply because it did not live up to its
original expectations. They had to shift gears. A reassessment of the strategic
implications of LSD was necessary. If, strictly speaking, LSD was not a
reliable truth drug, then how else could it be used?  CIA researchers were
intrigued by this new chemical, but they didn’t quite know what to make of it.
LSD was significantly different from anything else they knew about. “The most
fascinating thing about it,” a CIA psychologist recalled, “was that such minute
quantities had such a terrible effect.” Mere micrograms could create “serious
mental confusion... and render the mind temporarily susceptible to
suggestion”.  Moreover, the drug was colorless, odorless, and tasteless, and
therefore easily concealed in food and beverage. But it was hard to predict the
response to LSD. On certain occasions acid seemed to cause an uninhibited
disclosure of information, but oftentimes the overwhelming anxiety experienced
by the subject obstructed the interrogation process. And there were
unexplainable mood swings—from total panic to boundless blissout. How could one
drug produce such extreme behavior and contradictory reactions?  It didn’t make
sense. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As research continued, the situation became even
more perplexing. At one point a group of Security officers did an about-face
and suggested that acid might best be employed as an anti-interrogation
substance: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“Since information obtained from a person in a psychotic
state would be unrealistic, bizarre, and extremely difficult to assess, the <i>self-administration</i>
of LSD-25, which is effective in minute doses, might in special circumstances
offer an operative temporary protection against interrogation [emphasis added].”
</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This proposal was somewhat akin to a suicide pill
scenario. Secret agents would be equipped with micro-pellets of LSD to take on
dangerous assignments. If they fell into enemy hands and were about to be
interrogated, they could pop a tab of acid as a preventive measure and babble
gibberish. Obviously this idea was impractical, but it showed just how confused
the CIA’s top scientists were about LSD. First they thought it was a true
serum, then a lie serum, and for a while they didn’t know what to think.  To
make matters worse, there was a great deal of concern within the Agency that
the Soviets and the Red Chinese might also have designs on LSD as an espionage
weapon. A survey conducted by the Officer of Scientific Intelligence noted that
ergot was a commercial product in numerous Eastern Bloc countries. The
enigmatic fungus also flourished in the Soviet Union, but Russian ergot had not
yet appeared in foreign markets. Could this mean the Soviets were hoarding
their supplies? Since information on the chemical structure of LSD was
available in scientific journals as early as 1947, the Russians might have been
stockpiling raw ergot in order to convert it into a mind control weapon. 
“Although no Soviet data are available on LSD-25,” the OSI study concluded, “it
must be assumed that the scientists of the USSR are thoroughly cognizant of the
strategic importance of this powerful new drug and are capable of producing it
at any time.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Were the Russian really into acid? “I’m sure they
were,” asserted John Gittlinger, one of the CIA’s leading psychologists during
the Cold War, “but if you ask me to prove it, I’ve never seen any direct proof
of it.” While hard evidence of a Soviet LSD connection was lacking, the CIA
wasn’t about to take any chances. What would happen, for example, if an
American spy was caught and dosed by the Commies? The CIA realized that an
adversary intelligence service could employ LSD “to produce anxiety or terror
in medically unsophisticated subjects unable to distinguish drug-induced psychosis
from actual insanity”. The only way to be sure that an operative would not
freak out under such circumstances would be to give him a taste of LSD (a mind
control vaccine?) before he was sent on a sensitive overseas mission. Such a
person would know that the effects of the drug were transitory and would
therefore be in a better position to handle the experience. CIA documents
actually refer to agents who were familiar with LSD as “enlightened
operatives”.  Along this line, Security officials proposed that LSD be
administered to CIA trainee volunteers.  Such a procedure would clearly
demonstrate to select individuals the effects of hallucinogenic substances upon
themselves and their associates.  Furthermore, it would provide an opportunity
to screen Agency personnel for “anxiety proneness”; those who couldn’t pass the
acid test would be excluded from certain critical assignments. This suggestion
was well received by the ARTICHOKE steering committee, although the
representative from the CIA’s Medical Office felt that the test should not be
“confined merely to male volunteer trainee personnel, but that it should be
broadened to include all components of the Agency”.  According to a CIA
document dated November 19, 1953, the Project Committee “verbally concurred in
this recommendation”. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>During the next few years numerous CIA agents tried
LSD. Some used the drug on repeated occasions. How did their firsthand
experience with acid affect their personalities? How did it affect their
attitude to their work—particularly those who were directly involved in mind
control research? What impact did it have on the program as a whole? </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At the outset of the CIA’s behavior control
endeavors the main emphasis was on speech-inducing drugs. But when acid entered
the scene, the entire program assumed a more aggressive posture. The CIA’s
turned-on strategic came to believe that mind control techniques could be
applied to a wide range of operations above and beyond the strict category of
“special interrogation”. It was almost as if LSD blew the Agency’s collective
mind-set—or was it mind-rut? With acid acting as a catalyst, the whole idea of
what could be done with a drug , or drugs in general, was suddenly transformed.
Soon a perfect compound was envisioned for every conceivable circumstance:
there would be smart shots, memory erasers, “antivitamins”, knock-out drops,
“aphrodisiacs for operational use”, drugs that caused “headache clusters” or
uncontrollable twitching, drugs that could induce cancer, a stroke or a heart
attack without leaving a trace as to the source of the ailment. There were
chemicals to make a drunk man sober and a sober man as drunk as a fish. Even a
“recruitment” pill was contemplated. What’s more, according to a document dated
 May 5, 1955, the CIA placed a high priority on the development of a drug
“which will produce ‘pure euphoria’ with no subsequent letdown”. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This is not to suggest that the CIA had given up on
LSD. On the contrary, after grappling with the drug for a number of years, the
Agency devised new methods of interrogation based on the “far-out”
possibilities of this mind-altering substance.  When employed as a third-degree
tactic, acid enabled the CIA to approach a hostile subject with a great deal of
leverage. CIA operatives realized that intense mental confusion could be
produced by deliberately attacking a person along psychological lines. Of all
the chemicals that caused mental derangement, none was as powerful as LSD. Acid
not only made people extremely anxious, it also broke down the character defenses
for handling anxiety. A skillful interrogator could exploit this vulnerability
by threatening to keep an unwitting subject in a tripped-out state indefinitely
unless he spilled the beans. This tactic often proved successful where others
had failed. CIA documents indicate that LSD was employed as an aid to
interrogation on an operational basis from the mid-1950s through the early
1960s. </p>

<h1>Laboratories of the State </h1>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When the CIA first became interested in LSD, only a
handful of scientists in the United States were engaged in hallucinogenic drug
research. At the time there was little private or public support for this
relatively new field of experimental psychiatry, and no one had undertaken a
systematic investigation of LSD. The CIA’s mind control specialists sensed a
golden opportunity in the making. With a sizable treasure chest at their
disposal they were in a position to boost the careers of scientists whose skill
and expertise would be of maximum benefit to the CIA. Almost overnight a whole
new market for grants in LSD research sprang into existence as money started
pouring through CIA-linked conduits or “cutouts” such as the Geschickter Fund
for Medical Research, the Society for the Study of Human Ecology, and the
Josiah Macy, Jr Foundation.  Among those who benefited from t he CIA’s largesse
was Dr Max Rinkel, the first person to bring LSD to the United States. In 1949 Rinkel,
a research psychiatrist, obtained a supply of LSD from Sandoz Pharmaceuticals
in Switzerland and gave the drug to his partner, Dr Robert Hyde, who took the
first acid trip in the Western Hemisphere. Rinkel and Hyde went on to organize
an LSD study at the Boston Psychopathic Institute, a pioneering mental health
clinic affiliated with Harvard University.  They tested the drug on 100
volunteers and reported the initial findings in May 1950 (nearly three years
before the CIA began funding their work) at the annual meeting of the American
Psychiatric Association. Rinkel announced that LSD had produced “a transitory
psychotic disturbance” in normal subjects. This was highly significant, for it
raised the possibility that mental disorders could be studied objectively in a
controlled experimental setting.  Rinkel’s hypothesis was supported and
expanded upon during the same forum by Dr Paul Hoch, a prominent psychiatrist
who would also proffer his services to the CIA in the years ahead. Hoch
reported that the symptoms produced by LSD, mescaline, and related drugs were
similar to those of schizophrenia: intensity of color perception, hallucinations,
depersonalization, intense anxiety, paranoia, and in some cases catatonic
manifestations. As Hock put it, “LSD and Mescaline disorganize the psychic
integration of the individual.” he believed that the medical profession was
fortunate to have access to these substances, for now it would be possible to
reconstruct temporary or “model” psychoses in the laboratory. LSD was
considered an exceptional research tool in that the subject could provide a
detailed description of his experience while he was under the influence of the
drug. It was hoped that careful analysis of these data would shed new light on
schizophrenia and other enigmatic mental diseases. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hock’s landmark thesis—that LSD was a “psychotomimetic”
or “madness-mimicking” agent—caused a sensation in scientific circles and led
to several important and stimulating theories regarding the biochemical basis
of schizophrenia.  This in turn sparked an upsurge of interest in brain
chemistry and opened new vistas in the field of experimental psychiatry. In
light of the extremely high potency of LSD, it seemed completely plausible that
infinitesimal traces of a psychoactive substance produced through metabolic
dysfunction by the human organism might cause psychotic disturbances.
Conversely, attempts to alleviate a “lysergic psychosis” might point the way
toward cutting schizophrenia and other forms of mental illness. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>FOOTNOTE: While the miracle cure never panned out,
it is worth nothing that Thorazine was found to mollify an LSD reaction and
subsequently became a standard drug for controlling patients in mental asylums
and prisons. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As it turned out, the model psychosis concept
dovetailed particularly well with the secret schemes of the CIA, which also
viewed LSD in terms of its ability to blow minds and make people crazy. Thus it
is not surprising that the CIA chose to invest in men like Rinkel and Hoch.
Most scientists were flattered by the government’s interest in their research,
and they were eager to assist the CIA in its attempts to unravel the riddle of
LSD. This was, after all, the Cold War, and one did not have to be a blue-ribboned
hawk or a hard-liner to work in tandem with American intelligence. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the early 1950s the CIA approached Dr Nick Bercel,
a psychiatrist who maintained a private practice in Los Angeles. Bercel was one
of the first people in the United States to work with LSD, and the CIA asked
him to consider a haunting proposition. What would happen if the Russians put
LSD in the water supply of a large American city?  A skillful saboteur could
carry enough acid in his coat pocket to turn an entire metropolis into a loony
bin, assuming he found a way to distribute it equally. In light of this
frightening prospect, would Bercel render a patriotic service by calculating
exactly how much LSD would be required to contaminate the water supply of Los
  Angeles?  Bercel consented, and that evening he dissolved a tiny amount of
acid in a glass of tap water, only to discover that the chlorine neutralized
the drug. “Don’t worry,” he told his CIA contact, “it won’t work.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Agency took this as a mandate, and another
version of LSD was eventually concocted to overcome the drawback. A CIA
document state accordingly, “If the concept of contaminating a city’s water
supply seems, or in actual fact, is found to be far-fetched (this is by no
means certain), there is still the possibility of contaminating, say, the water
supply of a bomber base or, more easily still, that of a battleship.... Our
current work contains the strong suggestion that LSD-25 will produce hysteria
(unaccountable laughing, anxiety, terror).... It requires little imagination to
realize what the consequences might be if a battleship’s crew were so
affected.” The CIA never got in touch with Bercel again, but they monitored his
research reports in various medical journals. When Bercel gave LSD to spiders,
they spun perfectly symmetrical webs. Animal studies also showed that cats
cringed before untreated mice, and fish that normally swam close to the bottom
of a water tank hovered near the top. In another experiment Dr Louis Joylon
(“Jolly”) West, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Oklahoma,
injected an elephant with a massive dose of 300,000 micrograms. Dr West, a CIA
contract employee and an avid believer in the notion that hallucinogens were psychotomimetic
agents, was trying to duplicate the periodic “rut” madness that overtakes male
elephants for about one week each year. But the animal did not experience a
model elephant psychosis; it just keeled over and remained in a motionless
stupor. In attempting to revive the elephant, West administered a combination
of drugs that ended up killing the poor beast. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Research on human subjects showed that LSD lodged
primarily in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Only a tiny amount (.01%) of the
original dose entered the brain, and it only remained there for 20 minutes.
This was a most curious finding, as the effect of LSD was not evident until the
drug had disappeared entirely from the central nervous system. Some scientists
thought LSD might act as a trigger mechanism, releasing or inhibiting a
naturally occurring substance in the brain, but no one could figure out exactly
why the drug had such a dramatic effect on the mind.  Many other questions were
in need of clarification. Could the drug be fatal? What was the maximum dose?
Were the effects constant, or were there variations according to different
personality types? Could the reaction be accentuated by combining LSD with
other chemicals?  Was there an antidote? Some of these questions overlapped
with legitimate medical concerns, and researchers on CIA stipends published
unclassified versions of their work in prestigious scientific periodicals. But
these accounts omitted secret data given to the CIA on how LSD affected “operationally
pertinent categories” such as disturbance of memory, alteration of sex
patterns, eliciting information, increasing suggestibility, and creating
emotional dependence.  The CIA was particularly interested in psychiatric
reports suggesting that LSD could break down familiar behavior patterns, for
this raised the possibility of reprogramming or brainwashing. If LSD
temporarily altered a person’s view of the world and suspended his belief
system, CIA doctors surmised, then perhaps Russian spies could be cajoled into
switching loyalties while they were tripping. The brainwashing strategy was
relatively simple: find the subject’s weakest point (his “squeaky board”) and
bear down on it. Use any combination or synthesis which might “open the mind to
the power of suggestion to a degree never hitherto dreamed possible”. LSD would
be employed to provoke a reality shift, to break someone down and tame him, to
find a locus of anonymity and leave a mark there forever.  To explore the
feasibility of this approach, the Agency turned to Dr Ewen Cameron, a respected
psychiatrist who served as president of the Canadian, the American, and the
World Psychiatric Association before his death in 1967. Cameron also directed
the Allain Memorial Institute at Montreal’s McGill University, where he
developed a bizarre and unorthodox method for treating schizophrenia. With
financial backing from the CIA he tested his method on 53 patients at Allain.
The so-called treatment started with “sleep therapy”, in which subjects were
knocked out for months at a time. The next phase, “depatterning”, entailed
massive electroshock and frequent doses of LSD designed to wipe out past
behavior patterns. Then Cameron tried to recondition the mind through a
technique known as “psychic driving”. The patients, once again heavily sedated,
were confined to “sleep rooms” where tape-recorded messages played over and
over from speakers under their pillows. Some heard the message a quarter of a
million times. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Cameron’s methods were later discredited, and the CIA
grudgingly gave up on the notion of LSD as a brainwashing technique. But that
was little consolation to those who served as guinea pigs for the CIA’s secret
mind control projects. Nine of Cameron’s former patients have sued the American
government for $1,000,000 each, claiming that they are still suffering from the
trauma they went through at Allain. These people never agreed to participate in
a scientific experiment—a fact which reflects little credit on the CIA, even if
the Agency officials feared that the Soviets were spurting ahead in the mind
control race. The CIA violated the Nuremberg Code for medical ethics by
sponsoring experiments on unwitting subjects.  Ironically, Dr Cameron was a
member of the Nuremberg tribunal that heard the case against Nazi war criminals
who committed atrocities during World War II. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Like the Nazi doctors at Dachau, the CIA victimized
certain groups of people, who were unable to resist: prisoners, mental
patients, foreigners, the terminally ill, sexual deviants, ethnic minorities.
One project took place at the Addiction Research Centre of the US Public Health
Service Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky. Lexington was ostensibly a place where
heroin addicts could go to shake a habit, and although it was officially a
penitentiary, all the inmates were referred to as “patients”. The patients had
their own way of referring to the doctors—“hacks” or “croakers”—who patrolled
the premises in military uniforms. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The patients at Lexington had no way of knowing that
it was one of 15 penal and mental institutions utilized by the CIA in its
super-secret drug development program. To conceal its role the Agency enlisted
the aid of the navy and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), which
served as conduits for channeling money to Dr Harris Isbell, a gung-ho research
scientist who remained on the CIA payroll for over a decade. According to CIA
documents the directors of NIMH and the National Institutes of Health were
fully cognizant of the Agency’s “interest” in Isbell’s work and offered “full
support and protection”. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When the CIA came across a new drug (usually
supplied by American pharmaceutical firms) that needed testing, the frequently
sent it over to their chief doctor at Lexington, where an ample supply of
captive guinea pigs was readily available. Over 800 compounds were farmed out
to Isbell, including LSD and a variety of hallucinogens. It became an open
secret among street junkies that if the supply got tight, you could always
commit yourself to Lexington, where heroin and morphine were doled out as
payment if you volunteered for Isbell’s wacky drug experiments. (Small wonder
that Lexington had a return rate of 90%.) Dr Isbell, a longtime member of the
Food and Drug Administration’s Advisory Committee on the Abuse of Depressant and
Stimulant Drugs, defended the volunteer program on the grounds that there was
no precedent at the time for offering inmates cash for their services.  CIA
documents describe experiments conducted by Isbell in which certain
patients—nearly all black inmates—were given LSD for more than 75 consecutive
days. In order to overcome tolerance to the hallucinogen, Isbell administered
“double, triple and quadruple doses”. A report dated May 5, 1959, comments on an experiment involving psilocybin (a semi-synthetic version of the magic
mushroom). Subjects who ingested the drug became extremely anxious, although
sometimes there were periods of intense elation marked by “continuous gales of
laughter”. A few patients felt that they “had become very large, or had shrunk to
the size of children. Their hands of feet did not seem to be their own and
sometimes took on the appearance of animal paws.... They reported many
fantasies or dreamlike states in which they seemed to be elsewhere. Fantastic
experiences, such as trips to the moon or living in gorgeous castles, were occassionally
reported.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Isbell concluded, </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“Despite these striking subjective experiences, the
patients remained oriented in time, place, and person. In most instances, the
patients did not lose their insight but realized that the effects were due to
the drug. Two of the nine patients, however, did lose insight and felt that
their experiences were cased by the experimenters controlling their minds.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In addition to his role as a research scientists, Dr
Isbell served as a go-between for the CIA in its attempt to obtain drug samples
from European pharmaceutical concerns which assumed they were providing
“medicine” to a US Public Health official. The CIA in turn acted as a research
coordinator, passing information, tips, and leads to Isbell and its other
contract employees so that they could keep abreast of each other’s progress;
when a new discovery was made, the CIA would often ask another researcher to
conduct a follow-up study for confirmation. One scientist whose work was
coordinated with Isbell’s in such a manner was Dr Carl Pfeiffer, a noted
pharmacologist from Princeton who tested LSD on inmates at the federal prison
in Atlanta and the Bordentown Reformatory in New Jersey. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Isbell, Pfeiffer, Cameron, West, and Hoch—all were
part of a network of doctors and scientists who gathered intelligence for the
CIA. Through these scholar-informants the Agency stayed on top of the latest
developments within the “aboveground” LSD scene, which expanded rapidly during
the Cold War. By the mid-1950s numerous independent investigators had
undertaken hallucinogenic drug studies, and the CIA was determined not to let
the slightest detail escape its grasp. In a communique dated May 26, 1954, the Agency ordered all domestic field offices in the United States to
monitor scientists engaged in LSD research. People of interest, the memo
explained, “will most probably be found in biochemistry departments of
universities, mental hospitals, private psychiatric practice.... We do ask that
you remember their importance and report their work when it comes to your
attention.” The CIA also expended considerable effort to monitor the latest
development in LSD research on a world-wide scale. Drug specialists funded by
the Agency made periodic trips to Europe to confer with scientists and
representatives of various pharmaceutical concerns, including, of course, Sandoz
Laboratories. Initially the Swiss firm provided LSD to investigators all over
the world free of charge, in exchange for full access to their research data.
(CIA researchers did not comply with this stipulation.) By 1953, Sandoz had
decided to deal directly with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which
assumed a supervisory role in distributing LSD to American investigators from
then on. It was a superb arrangement as far as the CIA was concerned, for the
FDA went out of its way to assist the secret drug program. With the FDA as its
junior partner, the CIA not only had ready access to supplies of LSD (which Sandoz
marketed for a while under the brand name Delysid) but also was able to keep a
close eye on independent researchers in the United States.  The CIA would have
been content to let the FDA act as an intermediary in its dealings with Sandoz,
but business as usual was suspended when the Agency learned of an offer that
could not be refused. Prompted by reports that large quantities of the drug
were suddenly available, top-level CIA officials authorized the purchase of 10 <i>kilos</i>
of LSD from Sandoz at an estimated price of 4240,000 -- enough for a staggering
100 million doses. A document dated November 16, 1953, characterized the
pending transaction as a “risky operation”, but CIA officials felt it was
necessary, if only to preclude any attempt the Communists might make to get
their hands on the drug. What the CIA intended to do with such an incredible
stash of acid was never made clear.  The CIA later found out that Sandoz had
never produced LSD in quantities even remotely resembling ten kilograms.
Apparently only 10 milligrams were for sale, but a CIA contact in Switzerland
mistook a kilogram, 1,000 grams, for a milligram (.001 grams), which would
explain the huge discrepancy. Nevertheless, Sandoz officials were pleased by
the CIA’s interest in their product, and the two organizations struck up a
cooperative relationship. Arthur Stoll, president of Sandoz, agreed to keep the
CIA posted whenever new LSD was produced or a shipment was delivered to a
customer. Likewise, any information concerning LSD research behind the Iron
Curtain would be passed along confidentially.  But the CIA did not want to
depend on a foreign company for supplies of a substance considered vital to
American security interests. The Agency asked the Eli Lilly Company in Indianapolis
to try to synthesize a batch of all-American acid. By mid-1954 Lilly had
succeeded in breaking the secret formula held by Sandoz. “This is a closely
guarded secret,” a CIA document declared, “and should not be mentioned
generally.” Scientists as Lilly assured the CIA that “in a matter of months LSD
would be available in tonnage quantities”. </p>

<h1>Midnight Climax </h1>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In a speech before the National Alumni Conference at
  Princeton University on April 10, 1953, newly appointed CIA director Allen
Dulles lectured his audience on “how sinister the battle for men’s minds had
become in Soviet hands”. The human mind, Dulles warned, was a “malleable tool”,
and the Red Menace had secretly developed “brain perversion techniques”. Some
of these methods were “so subtle and so abhorrent to our way of life that we
have recoiled from facing up to them”. Dulles continued, “The minds of selected
individuals who are subjected to such treatment... are deprived of the ability
to state their own thoughts. Parrot-like, the individuals so conditioned can
merely repeat the thoughts which have been implanted in their minds by
suggestion from outside. In effect the brain... becomes a phonograph playing a
disc put on the spindle by an outside genius over which is has no control.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Three days after delivering this address Dulles
authorized Operation MK-ULTRA, the CIA’s major drug and mind control program
during the Cold War.  MK-ULTRA was the brainchild of Richard Helms, a
high-ranking member of the Clandestine Services (otherwise known as the “dirty
tricks department”) who championed such methods throughout his career as an
intelligence officer. As helms explained to Dulles when he first proposed the
MK-ULTRA project, “Aside from the offensive potential, the development of a
comprehensive capability in this field... gives us a thorough knowledge of the
enemy’s theoretical potential, thus enabling us to defend ourselves against a
foe who might not be as restrained in the use of these techniques as we are.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The supersecret MK-ULTRA program was run by a
relatively small unit within the CIA known as the Technical Services Staff
(TSS). Originally established as a supplementary funding mechanism to the
ARTICHOKE project, MK-ULTRA quickly grew into a mammoth undertaking that
outflanked earlier mind control initiatives. For a while both the TSS and the
Office of Security (which directed the ARTICHOKE project) were engaged in
parallel LSD tests, and a heated rivalry developed between the two groups.
Security officials were miffed because they had gotten into acid first and then
this new clique started cutting in on what the ARTICHOKE crowd considered their
rightful turf.  The internecine conflict grew to the point where the Office of
security decided to have one of its people spy on the TSS. This set off a
flurry of memos between the Security informant and his superiors, who were
dismayed when they learned that Dr Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who directed
the MK-ULTRA program, had approved a plan to give acid to unwitting American
citizens. The Office of Security had never attempted such a reckless
gesture—although it had its own idiosyncracies; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ARTICHOKE operatives, for example, were attempting
to have a hypnotized subject skill someone while in a trance. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Whereas the Office of Security utilized LSD as an
interrogation weapon, Dr Gottlieb had other ideas about what to do with the
drug. Because the effects of LSD were temporary (in contrast to the fatal nerve
agents), Gottlieb saw important strategic advantages for its use in covert
operations. For instance, a surreptitious dose of LSD might disrupt a person’s
thought process and cause him to act strangely or foolishly in public.  A CIA
document notes that administering LSD “to high officials would be a relatively
simple matter and could have a significant effect at key meetings, speeches, etc.”
But Gottlieb realized there was a considerable difference between testing LSD
in a laboratory and using the drug in clandestine operations. In an effort to
bridge the gap, he and his TSS colleagues initiated a series of in-house
experiments designed to find out what would happen if LSD was given to someone
in a “normal” life setting without advance warning.  They approached the
problem systematically, taking one step at a time, until they reached a point
where outsiders were zapped with no explanation whatsoever. First everyone in
Technical Services tried LSD. They tripped alone and in groups. A typical
experiment involved two people pairing off in a closed room where they observed
each other for hours at a time, took noted, and analyzed their experiences. As
Gottlieb later explained, “There was an extensive amount of
self-experimentation for the reason that we felt that a first hand knowledge of
the subjective effects of these drugs [was] important to those of us who were
involved in the program.” When they finally learned the hallucinogenic ropes,
so to speak, they agreed among themselves to slip LSD into each other’s drinks.
The target never knew when his turn would come, but as soon as the drug was
ingested a TSS colleague would tell him so he could make the necessary
preparations—which usually meant taking the rest of the day off. Initially the
leaders of MK-ULTRA restricted the surprise acid tests to TSS members, but when
this phase had run its course they started dosing other Agency personnel who
had never tripped before. Nearly everyone was fair game, and surprise acid
trips became something of an occupational hazard among CIA operatives. Such
tests were considered necessary because foreknowledge would prejudice the
results of the experiment. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Indeed, things were getting a bit raucous down at
headquarters. When Security officials discovered what was going on, they began
to have serious doubts about the wisdom of the TSS game plan.  MOral
reservations were not paramount; it was more a sense that the MK-ULTRA staff
had become unhinged by the hallucinogen. The Office of Security felt that the
TSS should have exercised better judgment in dealing with such a powerful and
dangerous chemical. The straw that broke the camel’s back came when a Security
informant got wind of a plan by a few TSS jokers to put LSD in the punch served
at the annual CIA Christmas office party. A security memo dated December 15, 1954, noted that acid could “produce serious insanity for periods of 8 to 18
hours and possibly for longer”. The writer of this memo concluded indignantly
and unequivocally that he did “not recommend testing in the Christmas punch
bowls usually present at the Christmas office parties”.  The purpose of these
early acid tests wa not to explore mystical realms or higher states of
consciousness. On the contrary, the TSS was trying to figure out how to employ
LSD in espionage operations. Nevertheless, there were times when CIA agents
found themselves propelled into a visionary world and they were deeply moved by
the experience. One MK-ULTRA veteran wept in front of his colleagues at the end
of his first trip. “I didn’t want it to leave,” he explained. “I felt I would
be going back to a place where I wouldn’t be able to hold on to this kind of
beauty.” His colleagues assumed he was having a bad trip and wrote a report
stating that the drug had made him psychotic. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Adverse reactions often occurred when people were
given LSD on an impromptu basis. One one occassion a CIA operative discovered
he’d been dosed during his morning coffee break. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“He sort of knew he had it,” a fellow-agent
recalled, “but he couldn’t pull himself together.  Somehow, when you known
you’ve taken it, you start the process of maintaining your composure. But this
grabbed him before he was aware, and it got away from him.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Then he got away from them and fled across
Washington stoned out of his mind while they searched frantically for their
missing comrade.  “He reported afterwards,” the TSS man continued, “that every
automobile that came by was a terrible monster with fantastic eyes, out to get
him personally. Each time a car passed he would huddle down against a parapet,
terribly frightened. It was a real horror for him. I mean, it was hours of
agony... like being in a dream that never stops—with someone chasing you.”
Incidents such as these reaffirmed to the MK-ULTRA crew just how devastating a
weapon LSD could be.  But this only made them more enthusiastic about the drug.
They kept springing it on people in a manner reminiscent of the ritual hazing
of fraternity pledges. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“It was just too damned informal,” a TSS officer
later said. “We didn’t know much. We were playing around in ignorance.... We
were just naive about what we were doing.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Such pranks claimed their first victim in November
1953, when a group of CIA and army technicians fathered for a three-day work
retreat at a remote hunting lodge in the backwoods of Maryland. On the second
day of the meeting Dr Gottlieb spiked the after-dinner cocktails with LSD. As
the drug began to take effect, Gottlieb told everyone that they had ingested a
mind-altering chemical. By that time the group had become boisterous with
laughter and unable to carry on a coherent conversation.  One man was not
amused by the unexpected turn of events. Dr Frank Olson, an army scientist who
specialized in biological warfare research, had never taken LSD before, and he
slid into a deep depression. His mood did not lighten when the conference
adjourned. Normally a gregarious family man, Olson returned home quiet and
withdrawn. When he went to work after the weekend, he asked his boss to fire
him because he had “messed up the experiment” during the retreat. Alarmed by
his erratic behavior, Olson’s superiors contacted the CIA, which sent him to New
  York to see Dr harold Abramson. A respected physician, Abramson taught at Columbia
 University and was chief of the allergy clinic at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was
also one of the CIA’s principal LSD researchers and a part-time consultant to
the Army Chemical Corps. While these were impressive credentials, Abramson was
not a trained psychiatrist, and it was this kind of counseling his patients
desperately needed. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For the next weeks Olson confided his deepest fears
to Abramson. He claimed the CIA was putting something in his coffee to make him
stay awake at night. He said people were plotting against him and he heard
voices at odd hours commanding him to throw away his wallet—which he did, even
though it contained several uncashed checks. Dr Abramson concluded that Olson
was mired in “a psychotic state... with delusions of persecution” that had been
“crystallized by the LSD experience”.  Arrangements were made to move him to
Chestnut Lodge, a sanitorium in Rockville, Maryland, staffed by CIA-cleared
psychiatrists. (Apparently other CIA personnel who suffered from psychiatric
disorders were enrolled in this institution.) On his last evening in New York,
Olson checked into a room at the Statler Hilton along with a CIA agent assigned
to watch him. And then, in the wee hours of the morning, the troubled scientist
plunged headlong through a closed window to his death 10 floors below. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Olson suicide had immediate repercussions within
the CIA. An elaborate cover-up erased clues to the actual circumstances leading
up to his death. Olson’s widow was eventually given a government pension, and
the full truth of what happened would not be revealed for another 20 years.
Meanwhile CIA director Allen Dulles suspended the in-house testing program for
a brief period while an internal investigation was conducted. In the end,
Gottlieb and his team received only a mildly worded reprimand for exercising
“bad judgment”, but no records of the incident were kept in their personnel
files which would harm their future careers. The importance of LSD eclipsed all
other considerations, and the secret acid tests resumed. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Gottlieb was now ready to undertake the final and
most daring phase of the MK-ULTRA program: LSD would be given to unwitting
targets in real-life situations. But who would actually do the dirty work?
While looking through some old OSS files, Gottlieb discovered that marijuana
had been tested on unsuspecting subjects in an effort to develop a truth serum.
These experiments had been organized by George Hunter White, a tough,
old-fashioned narcotics officer who ran a training school for American spies
during World War II. Perhaps White would be interested in testing drugs for the
CIA.  As a matter of protocol Gottlieb first approached Harry Anslinger, chief
of the Federal Narcotics Bureau. Anslinger was favorably disposed and agreed to
“lend” one of his top men to the CIA on a part-time basis. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Right from the start White had plenty of leeway in
running his operations. He rented an apartment in New York’s Greenwich Village,
and with funds supplied by the CIA he transformed it into a safehouse complete
with two-way mirrors, surveillance equipment, and the like. Posing as an artist
and a seaman, White lured people back to his pad and slipped them drugs. A clue
as to how his subjects fared can be found in White’s personal diary, which
contains passing references to surprise LSD experiments: “Gloria gets
horrors.... Janet sky high.” The frequency of bad reactions prompted White to
coin his own code word for the drug: “Stormy”, which was how he referred to LSD
throughout his 14-year stint as a CIA operative. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In 1955 White transferred to San Francisco, where
two more safehouses were established. During this period he initiated Operation
Midnight Climax, in which drug-addicted prostitutes were hired to pick up men
from local bars and bring them back to a CIA-financed bordello. Unknowing
customers were treated to drinks laced with LSD while White sat on a portable
toilet behind two-way mirrors, sipping martinis and watching every stoned and
kinky moment. As payment for their services the hookers received $100 a night,
plus a guarantee from White that he’d intercede on their behalf should they be
arrested while plying their trade.  In addition to providing data about LSD,
Midnight Climax enabled the CIA to learn about the sexual proclivities of those
who passed through the safehouses. White’s harem of prostitutes became the
focal point of an extensive CIA study of how to exploit the art of lovemaking
for espionage purposes. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When he wasn’t operating a national security
whorehouse, White would cruise the streets of San Francisco tracking down drug
pushers for the Narcotics Bureau. Sometimes after a tough day on the beat he
invited his narc buddies up to one of the safehouses for a little “R&R”. Occassionally
they unzipped their inhibitions and partied on the premises—much to the chagrin
of the neighbors, who began to complain about men with guns in shoulder straps
chasing after women in various states of undress. Needless to say, there was
always plenty of dope around, and the feds sampled everything from hashish to
LSD.  “So far as I’m concerned,” White later told an associate, “’clear
thinking’ was non-existent while under the influence of any of these drugs. I
did feel at times like I was having a ‘mind-expanding experience’, but this
vanished like a dream immediately after the session.” White had quite a scene
going for a while. By day he fought to keep drugs out of circulation, and by
night he dispensed them to strangers. Not everyone was cut out for this kind of
schizophrenic lifestyle, and White often relied on the bottle to reconcile the
two extremes. But there were still moments when his Jekyll-and-Hyde routine got
the best of him. One night a friend who had helped install bugging equipment
for the CIA stopped by the Safehouse only to find the roly-poly narcotics
officer slumped in front of a full-length mirror.  White had just finished
polishing off a half gallon of Gibson’s. The he sat, with gun in hand, shooting
wax slugs at his own reflection.  The safehouse experiments continued without
interruption until 1963, when CIA inspector general John Earman accidentally
stumbled across the clandestine testing program during a routine inspection of
TSS operations. Only a handful of CIA agents outside Technical Services knew
about the testing of LSD on unwitting subjects, and Earman took Richard Helms,
the prime instigator of MK-ULTRA, to task for not fully briefing the new CIA
director, John J McCone. Although McCone had been replaced by President Kennedy
to replace Allen Dulles as the dean of American intelligence, Helms apparently
had his own ideas about who was running the CIA. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Earman had grave misgivings about MK-ULTRA and he
prepared to 24-page report that included a comprehensive overview of the drug
and mind control projects. In a cover letter to McCone he noted that the
“concepts involved in manipulating human behavior are found by many people
within and outside the Agency to be disasterous and unethical”. But the
harshest criticism was reserved for the safehouse experiments, which, in his
words, placed “the rights and interests of US citizens in jeopardy”. Earman
stated that LSD had been tested on “individuals at all social levels, high and
low, native American and foreign”.  Numerous subjects had become ill,and some
required hospitalization for days and weeks at a time.  Moreover, the
sophomoric procedures employed during the safehouse sessions raised serious
questions about the validity of the data provided by White, who was hardly a
qualified scientist. As Earman pointed out, the CIA had no way of knowing
whether White was fudging the results to suit his own ends. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Earman recommended a freeze on unwitting drug tests
until the matter was fully considered at the higher level of the CIA. But
helms, then deputy director for covert operations (the number two position
within the Agency), defended the program.  In a memo dated November 9, 1964, he warned that the CIA’s “positive operational capacity to use drugs is diminishing
owing to a lack of realistic testing”, and he called for a resumption of the safehouse
experiments. While admitting that he had “no answer to the moral issue”, Helms
argued that such tests were necessary “to keep up with Soviet advances in this
field”. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This Cold War refrain had a familiar ring. Yet only
a few months earlier Helms had sung a different tune when J Lee Rankin, chief
counsel of the Warren Commission investigating the Kennedy assassination, asked
him to report on Soviet mind control initiatives. Helms stated his views in a
document dated June 16, 1964: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“Soviet research in the pharmacological agents
producing behavioral effects had consistently lagged five years <i>behind</i>
Western research [emphasis added].” Furthermore, he confidently asserted that
the Russians did not have “any singular, new potent drugs... to force a course
of action on an individual.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The bureaucratic wrangling at CIA headquarters
didn’t seem to bother George Hunter White, who kept on sending vouchers for
“unorthodox expenses” to Dr Sidney Gottlieb. No definitive record exists as to
when the unwitting acid tests were terminated, but it appears that White and
the CIA parted ways when he retired from the Narcotics Bureau in 1966.
Afterwards White reflected upon his service for the Agency in a letter to
Gottlieb: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“I was a very minor missionary, actually a heretic,
but I toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards because it was fun, fun, fun.
Where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, kill, cheat, steal, rape, and
pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All-Highest?” By this time the
CIA had developed a “stable of drugs”, including LSD, that were used in covert
operations. The decision to employ LSD on an operational basis was handled
through a special committee that reported directly to Richard Helms, who
characterized the drug as “dynamite” and asked to be “advised at all times when
it was intended for use”. A favorite plan involved slipping “P-1” (the code
name for LSD when used operationally) to socialist or left-leaning politicians
in foreign countries so that they would babble incoherently and discredit
themselves in public.  Fidel Castro was among the Third World leaders targeted
for surprise acid attacks. When this method proved unworkable, CIA strategists
thought of other ways to embarrass the Cuban president.  One scheme involved
dusting Castro’s shoes with thalium salts to make his beard fall out. 
Apparently they thought that Castro would lose his charisma along with his
hair. Eventually the Agency shifted its focus from bad trips nd close shaves to
eliminating Castro altogether. Gottlieb and his TSS cohorts were asked to
prepare an array of bizarre gadgets and biochemical poisons for a series of
murder conspiracies allying the CIA with anti-Castro mercenaries and the Mob. 
Egyptian president Gamal Abdal Nasser also figured high on the CIA’s
hallucinogenic hit list. While he managed to avoid such a fate, others
presumably were less fortunate. CIA documents cited in a documentary by ABC
News confirm that Gottlieb carried a stash of acid overseas on a number of
occasions during the Cold War with the intention of dosing foreign diplomats
and statesmen. But the effects of LSD were difficult to predict when employed
in such a haphazard manner, and the CIA used LSD only sparingly in operations
of this sort. </p>
