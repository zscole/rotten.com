<CENTER><A name=L4><STRONG>Introduction</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>Pursuant to Section 595(c) of Title 28, the Office of Independent Counsel 
(OIC) hereby submits substantial and credible information that President Clinton 
obstructed justice during the <U>Jones v. Clinton</U> sexual harassment lawsuit 
by lying under oath and concealing evidence of his relationship with a young 
White House intern and federal employee, Monica Lewinsky. After a federal 
criminal investigation of the President's actions began in January 1998, the 
President lied under oath to the grand jury and obstructed justice during the 
grand jury investigation. There also is substantial and credible information 
that the President's actions with respect to Monica Lewinsky constitute an abuse 
of authority inconsistent with the President's constitutional duty to faithfully 
execute the laws. 
<P>There is substantial and credible information supporting the following eleven 
possible grounds for impeachment: 
<P>1. President Clinton lied under oath in his civil case when he denied a 
sexual affair, a sexual relationship, or sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. 
<P>2. President Clinton lied under oath to the grand jury about his sexual 
relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. 
<P>3. In his civil deposition, to support his false statement about the sexual 
relationship, President Clinton also lied under oath about being alone with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and about the many gifts exchanged between Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
and him. 
<P>4. President Clinton lied under oath in his civil deposition about his 
discussions with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky concerning her involvement in the 
<U>Jones</U> case. 
<P>5. During the <U>Jones</U> case, the President obstructed justice and had an 
understanding with Ms. Lewinsky to jointly conceal the truth about their 
relationship by concealing gifts subpoenaed by Ms. Jones's attorneys. 
<P>6. During the <U>Jones</U> case, the President obstructed justice and had an 
understanding with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to jointly conceal the truth of their 
relationship from the judicial process by a scheme that included the following 
means: (i)&nbsp;Both the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky understood that they 
would lie under oath in the <U>Jones</U> case about their sexual relationship; 
(ii)&nbsp;the President suggested to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that she prepare an 
affidavit that, for the President's purposes, would memorialize her testimony 
under oath and could be used to prevent questioning of both of them about their 
relationship; (iii)&nbsp;Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky signed and filed the false affidavit; 
(iv)&nbsp;the President used Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's false affidavit at his 
deposition in an attempt to head off questions about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky; and 
(v)&nbsp;when that failed, the President lied under oath at his civil deposition 
about the relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. 
<P>7. President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by helping 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky obtain a job in New York at a time when she would have been a 
witness harmful to him were she to tell the truth in the <U>Jones</U> case. 
<P>8. President Clinton lied under oath in his civil deposition about his 
discussions with Vernon Jordan concerning Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's involvement in the 
<U>Jones</U> case. 
<P>9. The President improperly tampered with a potential witness by attempting 
to corruptly influence the testimony of his personal secretary, Betty Currie, in 
the days after his civil deposition. 
<P>10. President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice during the grand jury 
investigation by refusing to testify for seven months <U>and</U> lying to senior 
White House aides with knowledge that they would relay the President's false 
statements to the grand jury -- and did thereby deceive, obstruct, and impede 
the grand jury. 
<P>11. President Clinton abused his constitutional authority by (i)&nbsp;lying 
to the public and the Congress in January 1998 about his relationship with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky; (ii)&nbsp;promising at that time to cooperate fully with the 
grand jury investigation; (iii)&nbsp;later refusing six invitations to testify 
voluntarily to the grand jury; (iv)&nbsp;invoking Executive Privilege; 
(v)&nbsp;lying to the grand jury in August 1998; and (vi)&nbsp;lying again to 
the public and Congress on August 17, 1998 -- all as part of an effort to 
hinder, impede, and deflect possible inquiry by the Congress of the United 
States. 
<P>The first two possible grounds for impeachment concern the President's lying 
under oath about the nature of his relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. The 
details associated with those grounds are, by their nature, explicit. The 
President's testimony unfortunately has rendered the details essential with 
respect to those two grounds, as will be explained in those grounds. <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2"><BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L5><STRONG>I. There is substantial and credible information that 
President Clinton lied under oath as a defendant in <U>Jones v. Clinton</U> 
regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. </STRONG>
<P>
<P><A name=L6><STRONG>(1) He denied that he had a "sexual relationship" with 
Monica Lewinsky.</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L7><STRONG>(2) He denied that he had a "sexual affair" with Monica 
Lewinsky.</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L8><STRONG>(3) He denied that he had "sexual relations" with Monica 
Lewinsky.</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L9><STRONG>(4) He denied that he engaged in or caused contact with 
the genitalia of "any person" with an intent to arouse or gratify (oral sex 
performed on him by Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky).</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L10><STRONG>(5) He denied that he made contact with Monica Lewinsky's 
breasts or genitalia with an intent to arouse or gratify.</STRONG> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>On May 6, 1994, former Arkansas state employee Paula Corbin Jones filed a 
federal civil rights lawsuit against President Clinton claiming that he had 
sexually harassed her on May 8, 1991, by requesting her to perform oral sex on 
him in a suite at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock. Throughout the pretrial 
discovery process in <U>Jones v. Clinton</U>, United States District Judge Susan 
Webber Wright ruled, over the President's objections, that Ms.&nbsp;Jones's 
lawyers could seek various categories of information, including information 
about women who had worked as government employees under Governor or President 
Clinton and allegedly had sexual activity with him. Judge Wright's rulings 
followed the prevailing law in sexual harassment cases: The defendant's sexual 
relationships with others in the workplace, including consensual relationships, 
are a standard subject of inquiry during the discovery process. Judge Wright 
recognized the commonplace nature of her discovery rulings and stated that she 
was following a "meticulous standard of materiality" in allowing such 
questioning. 
<P>At a hearing on January 12, 1998, Judge Wright required Ms.&nbsp;Jones to 
list potential trial witnesses. Ms.&nbsp;Jones's list included several "Jane 
Does."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys said they intended to call a Jane Doe named Monica 
Lewinsky as a witness to support Ms.&nbsp;Jones's claims. Under Ms.&nbsp;Jones's 
legal theory, women who had sexual relationships with the President received job 
benefits because of the sexual relationship, but women who resisted the 
President's sexual advances were denied such benefits.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> 
<P>On January 17, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Jones's lawyers deposed President Clinton under 
oath with Judge Wright present and presiding over the deposition. Federal law 
requires a witness testifying under oath to provide truthful answers. The 
intentional failure to provide truthful answers is a crime punishable by 
imprisonment 
<P>and fine.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> At 
the outset of his deposition, the President took an oath administered by Judge 
Wright: "Do you swear or affirm .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the testimony you are about 
to give in the matter before the court is the truth, the whole truth, and 
nothing but the truth, so help you God?" The President replied: "I do."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> At 
the beginning of their questioning, Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys asked the 
President: "And your testimony is subject to the penalty of perjury; do you 
understand that, sir?" The President responded, "I do."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> 
<P>Based on the witness list received in December 1997 (which included Ms. 
Lewinsky) and the January 12, 1998, hearing, the President and his attorneys 
were aware that Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys likely would question the President 
at his deposition about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and the other "Jane Does." In fact, 
the attorneys for Ms.&nbsp;Jones did ask numerous questions about "Jane Does," 
including Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. 
<P>There is substantial and credible information that President Clinton lied 
under oath in answering those questions. 
<P><A name=L11><STRONG>A. Evidence that President Clinton Lied Under Oath During 
the Civil Case</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L12><STRONG>1. President Clinton's Statements Under Oath About Monica 
Lewinsky</STRONG> 
<P>
<P>During pretrial discovery, Paula Jones's attorneys served the President with 
written interrogatories.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> One 
stated in relevant part: 
<P>Please state the name, address, and telephone number of each and every 
[federal employee] with whom you had sexual relations when you [were] 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. President of the United States.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The interrogatory did not define the term "sexual relations." Judge Wright 
ordered the President to answer the interrogatory, and on December 23, 1997, 
under penalty of perjury, President Clinton answered "None."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A> 
<P>At the January 17, 1998, deposition of the President, Ms.&nbsp;Jones's 
attorneys asked the President specific questions about possible sexual activity 
with Monica Lewinsky. The attorneys used various terms in their questions, 
including "sexual affair," "sexual relationship," and "sexual relations." The 
terms "sexual affair" and "sexual relationship" were not specially defined by 
Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys. The term "sexual relations" was defined: 
<P>For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in "sexual relations" 
when the person knowingly engages in or causes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. contact with the 
genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an 
intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any 
person.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Contact" means intentional touching, either 
directly or through clothing.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>President Clinton answered a series of questions about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, 
including: 
<P>Q: Did you have an extramarital sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky? <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: <U>No.</U> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: If she told someone that she had a sexual affair with you beginning in 
November of 1995, would that be a lie? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: <U>It's certainly not the truth. It would not be the truth.</U> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: I think I used the term "sexual affair." And so the record is completely 
clear, have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is 
defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as modified by the Court? 
<P>
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Bennett:<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>I object because I don't know that he can remember -- <BR wp="br1"><BR 
wp="br2">
<P>Judge Wright: <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Well, it's real short. He can -- I will permit the question and you may show 
the witness definition number one. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: <U>I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. I've never 
had an affair with her</U>.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>President Clinton reiterated his denial under questioning by his own 
attorney: 
<P>Q: In paragraph eight of [Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's] affidavit, she says this, "I 
have never had a sexual relationship with the President, he did not propose that 
we have a sexual relationship, he did not offer me employment or other benefits 
in exchange for a sexual relationship, he did not deny me employment or other 
benefits for rejecting a sexual relationship." Is that a true and accurate 
statement as far as you know it? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: <U>That is absolutely true.</U><A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L13><STRONG>2. Monica Lewinsky's Testimony</STRONG> 
<P>Monica Lewinsky testified under oath before the grand jury that, beginning in 
November 1995, when she was a 22-year-old White House intern, she had a lengthy 
relationship with the President that included substantial sexual activity. She 
testified in detail about the times, dates, and nature of ten sexual encounters 
that involved some form of genital contact. As explained in the Narrative 
section of this Referral, White House records corroborate Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's 
testimony in that the President was in the Oval Office area during the 
encounters. The records of White House entry and exit are incomplete for 
employees, but they do show her presence in the White House on eight of those 
occasions.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A> 
<P>The ten incidents are recounted here because they are necessary to assess 
whether the President lied under oath, both in his civil deposition, where he 
denied any sexual relationship at all, and in his grand jury testimony, where he 
acknowledged an "inappropriate intimate contact" but denied <U>any</U> sexual 
contact with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia. When reading the 
following descriptions, the President's denials under oath should be kept in 
mind. 
<P>Unfortunately, the nature of the President's denials requires that the 
contrary evidence be set forth in detail. If the President, in his grand jury 
appearance, had admitted the sexual activity recounted by Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and 
conceded that he had lied under oath in his civil deposition, these particular 
descriptions would be superfluous. Indeed, we refrained from questioning Ms. 
Lewinsky under oath about particular details until after the President's August 
17 testimony made that questioning necessary. But in view of (i) the President's 
denials, (ii) his continued contention that his civil deposition testimony was 
legally accurate under the terms and definitions employed, and (iii) his refusal 
to answer related questions, the detail is critical. The detail provides 
credibility and corroboration to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony. It also 
demonstrates with clarity that the Pres ident lied under oath <U>both</U> in his 
civil deposition <U>and</U> to the federal grand jury.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_14_"><SUP>(14)</SUP></A> 
There is substantial and credible information that the President's lies about 
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky were abundant and calculating. 
<P><A name=L14><STRONG>(i) Wednesday, November 15, 1995</STRONG> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she had her first sexual contact with the 
President on the evening of Wednesday, November 15, 1995, while she was an 
intern at the White House. Two times that evening, the President invited 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to meet him near the Oval Office.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_15_"><SUP>(15)</SUP></A> On 
the first occasion, the President took Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky back into the Oval 
Office study, and they kissed.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A> On 
the second, she performed oral sex on the President in the hallway outside the 
Oval Office study.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_17_"><SUP>(17)</SUP></A> 
During this encounter, the President directly touched and kissed 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's bare breasts.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_18_"><SUP>(18)</SUP></A> In 
addition, the President put his hand down Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's pants and directly 
stimulated her genitalia (acts clearly within the definition of "sexual 
relations" used at the <U>Jones</U> deposition).<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_19_"><SUP>(19)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L15><STRONG>(ii) Friday, November 17, 1995</STRONG> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she met with the President again two days 
later, on Friday, November 17, 1995.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_20_"><SUP>(20)</SUP></A> 
During that encounter, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky stated, she performed oral sex on the 
President in the private bathroom outside the Oval Office study.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_21_"><SUP>(21)</SUP></A> The 
President initiated the oral sex by unzipping his pants and exposing his 
genitals. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky understood the President's actions to be a sign that 
he wanted her to perform oral sex on him.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_22_"><SUP>(22)</SUP></A> 
During this encounter, the President also fondled Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's bare 
breasts with his hands and kissed her breasts.<A

<P><A name=L16><STRONG>(iii) Sunday, December 31, 1995</STRONG> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she met with the President on New Year's 
Eve, Sunday, December 31, 1995, after the President invited her to the Oval 
Office.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_24_"><SUP>(24)</SUP></A> 
Once there, the President lifted Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's sweater, fondled her bare 
breasts with his hands, and kissed her breasts. She stated that she performed 
oral sex on the President in the hallway outside the Oval Office study.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_25_"><SUP>(25)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L17><STRONG>(iv) Sunday, January 7, 1996</STRONG> 
<P>Monica Lewinsky testified that she performed oral sex on the President in the 
bathroom outside the Oval Office study during the late afternoon on Sunday, 
January 7, 1996.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_26_"><SUP>(26)</SUP></A> The 
President arranged this encounter by calling Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky at home and 
inviting her to visit.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_27_"><SUP>(27)</SUP></A> On 
that occasion, the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky went into the bathroom, where 
he fondled her bare breasts with his hands and mouth. During this encounter, the 
President stated that he wanted to perform oral sex on Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, but 
she stopped him for a physical reason.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_28_"><SUP>(28)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L18><STRONG>(v) Sunday, January 21, 1996</STRONG> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she and the President had a sexual encounter 
on the afternoon of Sunday, January 21, 1996, after he invited her to the Oval 
Office.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_29_"><SUP>(29)</SUP></A> The 
President lifted Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's top and fondled her bare breasts.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_30_"><SUP>(30)</SUP></A> The 
President unzipped his pants and exposed his genitals, and she performed oral 
sex on him in the hallway outside the Oval Office study.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_31_"><SUP>(31)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L19><STRONG>(vi) Sunday, February 4, 1996</STRONG> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she and the President had sexual contact in 
the Oval Office study and in the adjacent hallway on the afternoon of Sunday, 
February 4, 1996.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_32_"><SUP>(32)</SUP></A> 
That day, the President had called Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_33_"><SUP>(33)</SUP></A> 
During their encounter, the President partially removed Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's 
dress and bra and touched her bare breasts with his mouth and hands. He also 
directly touched her genitalia.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_34_"><SUP>(34)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky performed oral sex on the President.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_35_"><SUP>(35)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L20><STRONG>(vii) Sunday, March 31, 1996</STRONG> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she and the President had sexual contact in 
the hallway outside the Oval Office study during the late afternoon of Sunday, 
March 31, 1996.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_36_"><SUP>(36)</SUP></A> The 
President arranged this encounter by calling Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and inviting her 
to the Oval Office. During this encounter, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky did not perform 
oral sex on the President. The President fondled Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's bare 
breasts with his hands and mouth and fondled her genitalia directly by pulling 
her underwear out of the way. In addition, the President inserted a cigar into 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's vagina.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_37_"><SUP>(37)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L21><STRONG>(viii) Sunday, April 7, 1996</STRONG> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she and the President had sexual contact on 
Easter Sunday, April 7, 1996, in the hallway outside the Oval Office study and 
in the study itself.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_38_"><SUP>(38)</SUP></A> On 
that occasion, the President touched Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts, both through 
her clothing and directly. After the President unzipped his pants, 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky also performed oral sex on him.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_39_"><SUP>(39)</SUP></A> 
<P>This was their last in-person sexual encounter for over nine months. 
<P><A name=L22><STRONG>(ix) Friday, February 28, 1997</STRONG> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that her next sexual encounter with the President 
occurred on Friday, February 28, 1997, in the early evening.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_40_"><SUP>(40)</SUP></A> The 
President initiated this encounter by having his secretary Betty Currie call 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to invite her to the White House for a radio address. After 
the address, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and the President kissed by the bathroom. The 
President unbuttoned her dress and fondled her breasts, first with her bra on 
and then directly. He touched her genitalia through her clothes, but not 
directly, on this occasion. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky performed oral sex on him.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_41_"><SUP>(41)</SUP></A> On 
this day, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was wearing a blue dress that forensic tests have 
conclusively shown was stained with the President's semen.<A

<P><A name=L23><STRONG>(x) Saturday, March 29, 1997</STRONG> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she and the President had sexual contact on 
the afternoon of March 29, 1997, in the Oval Office study.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_43_"><SUP>(43)</SUP></A> On 
that occasion, the President unbuttoned Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's blouse and touched 
her breasts through her bra, but not directly. He also put his hands inside 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's pants and stimulated her genitalia.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_44_"><SUP>(44)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky performed oral sex on him, and they also had brief, direct 
genital-to-genital contact.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_45_"><SUP>(45)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L24><STRONG>(xi) Two Subsequent Meetings</STRONG> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she met with President Clinton in the Oval 
Office study on the morning of Saturday, August 16, 1997. They kissed, and 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky touched the President's genitals through his clothing, but he 
rebuffed her efforts to perform oral sex. No other sexual acts occurred during 
this encounter.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_46_"><SUP>(46)</SUP></A> 
<P>On Sunday, December 28, 1997, three weeks before the President's civil 
deposition in the <U>Jones</U> case, the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met in 
the Oval Office. In addition to discussing a number of issues that are analyzed 
below, they engaged in "passionate" kissing -- she said, "I don't call it a 
brief kiss." No other sexual contact occurred.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_47_"><SUP>(47)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L25><STRONG>3. Phone Sex </STRONG>
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she and the President engaged in "phone sex" 
approximately fifteen times. The President initiated each phone sex encounter by 
telephoning Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_48_"><SUP>(48)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L26><STRONG>4. Physical Evidence</STRONG> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky produced to OIC investigators a dress she wore during the 
encounter on February 28, 1997, which she believed might be stained with the 
President's semen. At the request of the OIC, the FBI Laboratory examined the 
dress and found semen stains.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_49_"><SUP>(49)</SUP></A> At 
that point, the OIC requested a DNA sample from the President. On August 3, 
1998, two weeks before the President's grand jury testimony, a White House 
physician drew blood from the President in the presence of a senior OIC attorney 
and a FBI special agent.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_50_"><SUP>(50)</SUP></A> 
Through the most sensitive DNA testing, RFLP testing, the FBI Laboratory

<P>During her relationship with the President, Monica Lewinsky spoke 
contemporaneously to several friends, family members, and counselors about the 
relationship. Their testimony corroborates many of the details of the sexual 
activity provided by Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to the OIC. 
<P><A name=L28><STRONG>(i) Catherine Allday Davis</STRONG> 
<P>Catherine Allday Davis, a college friend of Monica Lewinsky's,<A

According to Ms.&nbsp;Davis, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky told her that the relationship 
included mutual kissing and hugging, as well as oral sex performed by 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on the President. She also stated that the President touched 
Monica "on her breasts and on her vagina."<A

Ms.&nbsp;Erbland also said that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky described the cigar incident

her sexual relationship with the President. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky first informed 
Ms.&nbsp;Ungvari of the sexual relationship on November 23, 1995. 
Ms.&nbsp;Ungvari specifically remembers the date because it was her birthday.<A

According to Mr.&nbsp;Bleiler, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said that the relationship did

Mr.&nbsp;Bleiler about the cigar incident discussed above, and sexual activity 
in which the man touched Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's genitals and caused her to have an

that the first sexual encounter with the President had occurred on November 15, 
1995, when Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky performed oral sex on him. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky told 
Ms.&nbsp;Tripp that, during the course of this sexual relationship, she

<P><A name=L38><STRONG>6. Summary</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The detailed testimony of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, her corroborating prior 
consistent statements to her friends, family members, and counselors, and the 
evidence of the President's semen on Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's dress establish that 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and the President engaged in substantial sexual activity 
between November 15, 1995, and December 28, 1997.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_89_"><SUP>(89)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President, however, testified under oath in the civil case -- both in his 
deposition and in a written answer to an interrogatory -- that he did <U>not</U> 
have a "sexual relationship" or a "sexual affair" or "sexual relations" with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. In addition, he denied engaging in activity covered by a more 
specific definition of "sexual relations" used at the deposition.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_90_"><SUP>(90)</SUP></A> 
<P>In his civil case, the President made five different false statements related 
to the sexual relationship. For four of the five statements, the President 
asserts a semantic defense: The President argues that the terms used in the 
<U>Jones</U> deposition to cover sexual activity did not cover the sexual 
activity in which he engaged with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. For his other false 
statements, the President's response is factual -- namely, he disputes 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's account that he ever touched her breasts or genitalia during 
sexual activity.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_91_"><SUP>(91)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President's denials -- semantic and factual -- do not withstand scrutiny. 

<P><U>First</U><A name=L39><STRONG>,</STRONG> in his civil deposition, the 
President denied a "sexual affair" with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky (the term was not 
defined). The President's response to lying under oath on this point rests on 
his definition of "sexual affair" -- namely, that it requires sexual 
intercourse, no matter how extensive the sexual activities might otherwise be. 
According to the President, a man could regularly engage in oral sex and 
fondling of breasts and genitals with a woman and yet not have a "sexual affair" 
with her. 
<P><U>Second</U>, in his civil deposition, the President also denied a "sexual 
relationship" with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky (the term was not defined). The President's 
response to lying under oath on this point similarly rests on his definition of 
"sexual relationship" -- namely, that it requires sexual intercourse. Once 
again, under the President's theory, a man could regularly engage in oral sex 
and fondling of breasts and genitals with a woman, yet not have a "sexual 
relationship" with her. 
<P>The President's claim as to his interpretation of "sexual relationship" is 
belied by the fact that the President's own lawyer -- earlier at that same 
deposition -- equated the term "sexual relationship" with "sex of any kind in 
any manner, shape or form." The President's lawyer offered that interpretation 
when requesting Judge Wright to limit the questioning to prevent further 
inquiries with respect to Monica Lewinsky. As the videotape of the deposition 
reveals, the President was present and apparently looking in the direction of 
his attorney when his attorney offered that statement.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_92_"><SUP>(92)</SUP></A> The 
President gave no indication that he disagreed with his attorney's 
straightforward interpretation that the term "sexual relationship" means "sex of 
any kind in any manner, shape, or form." Nor did the President thereafter take 
any steps to correct the attorney's statement. 
<P><U>Third</U>, in an answer to an interrogatory submitted before his 
deposition, the President denied having "sexual relations" with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky (the term was not defined). Yet again, the President's 
apparent rejoinder to lying under oath on this point rests on his definition of 
"sexual relations" -- that it, too, requires sexual intercourse. According to 
President Clinton, oral sex does not constitute sexual relations. 
<P><U>Fourth</U>, in his civil deposition, the President denied committing any 
acts that fell within the specific definition of "sexual relations" that was in 
effect for purposes of that deposition. Under that specific definition, sexual 
relations occurs "when the person knowingly engages in or causes contact with 
the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with 
an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_93_"><SUP>(93)</SUP></A> 
Thus, the President denied engaging in or causing contact with the genitalia, 
breasts, or anus of "any person" with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual 
desire of "any person." 
<P>Concerning oral sex, the President's sole answer to the charge that he lied 
under oath at the deposition focused on his interpretation of "any person" in 
the definition. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she performed oral sex on the 
President on nine occasions. The President said that by <U>receiving</U> oral 
sex, he would not "engage in" or "cause"<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_94_"><SUP>(94)</SUP></A> 
contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of 
"any person" because "any person" really means "any <U>other</U> person." The 
President further testified before the grand jury: "[I]f the deponent is the 
person who has oral sex performed on him, then the contact is with -- <U>not 
with anything on that list, but with the lips of another person</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_95_"><SUP>(95)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President's linguistic parsing is unreasonable. Under the President's 
interpretation (which he says he followed at his deposition), in an oral sex 
encounter, one person <U>is</U> engaged in sexual relations, but the other 
person <U>is not</U> engaged in sexual relations.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_96_"><SUP>(96)</SUP></A> 
<P>Even assuming that the definitional language can be manipulated to exclude 
the deponent's receipt of oral sex, the President is still left with the 
difficulty that reasonable persons would not have understood it that way. And in 
context, the President's semantics become even weaker: The <U>Jones</U> suit 
rested on the allegation that the President sought to have Ms.&nbsp;Jones 
perform oral sex on him. Yet the President now claims that the expansive 
definition devised for deposition questioning should be interpreted to exclude 
that very act. 
<P><U>Fifth</U>, by denying at his civil deposition that he had engaged in any 
acts falling within the specific definition of "sexual relations," the President 
denied engaging in or causing contact with the breasts or genitalia of 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky with an intent to arouse or gratify one's sexual desire. In 
contrast to his explanations of the four preceding false statements under oath, 
the President's defense to lying under oath in this instance is purely 
<U>factual</U>. 
<P>As discussed above, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified credibly that the President 
touched and kissed her bare breasts on nine occasions, and that he stimulated 
her genitals on four occasions.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_97_"><SUP>(97)</SUP></A> She 
also testified about a cigar incident, which is discussed above. In addition, a 
deleted computer file from Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's home computer contained an 
apparent draft letter to the President that explicitly referred to an incident 
in which the President's "mouth [was] on [her] breast" and implicitly referred 
to direct contact with her genitalia.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_98_"><SUP>(98)</SUP></A> 
This draft letter further corroborates Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony. 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's prior consistent statements to various friends, family 
members, and counselors -- made when the relationship was ongoing -- likewise 
corroborate her testimony on the nature of the President's touching of her body. 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had no apparent motive to lie to her friends, family members, 
and counselors. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky especially had no reason to lie to 
Dr.&nbsp;Kassorla and Ms.&nbsp;Estep, to whom she related the facts in the 
course of a professional relationship. And Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's statements to 
some that she did not have intercourse with the President, even though she 
wanted to do so, enhances the credibility of her statements. Moreover, the 
precise nature of the sexual activity only became relevant after the President 
interposed his semantic defense regarding oral sex on August 17, 1998. 
<P>By contrast, the President's testimony strains credulity. His apparent 
"hands-off" scenario -- in which he would have received oral sex on <U>nine</U> 
occasions from Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky but never made direct contact with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia -- is not credible. The President's 
claim seems to be that he maintained a hands-off policy in ongoing sexual 
encounters with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, which coincidentally happened to permit him 
to truthfully deny "sexual relations" with her at a deposition occurring a few 
years in the future. As Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky noted, it suggests some kind of 
"service contract -- that all I did was perform oral sex on him and that that's 
all this relationship was."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_99_"><SUP>(99)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President also had strong personal, political, and legal motives to lie 
in the <U>Jones</U> deposition: He did not want to admit that he had committed 
extramarital sex acts with a young intern in the Oval Office area of the White 
House. Such an admission could support Ms.&nbsp;Jones's theory of liability and 
would embarrass him. Indeed, the President admitted that during the relationship 
he did what he could to keep the relationship secret, including "misleading" 
members of his family and Cabinet.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_100_"><SUP>(100)</SUP></A> 
The President testified, moreover, that he "hoped that this relationship would 
never become public."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_101_"><SUP>(101)</SUP></A> 
<P>At the time of his civil deposition, the President also could have presumed 
that he could lie under oath without risk because -- as he knew -- 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had already filed a false affidavit denying a sexual 
relationship with the President. Indeed, they had an understanding that each 
would lie under oath (explained more fully in Ground VI below). So the President 
might have expected that he could lie without consequence on the belief that no 
one could ever successfully challenge his denial of a sexual relationship with 
her. 
<P><U>In sum</U>, based on all of the evidence and considering the President's 
various responses, there is substantial and credible information that the 
President lied under oath in his civil deposition and his interrogatory answer 
in denying a sexual relationship, a sexual affair, or sexual relations with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_102_"><SUP>(102)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L40><STRONG>II. There is substantial and credible information that 
President Clinton lied under oath to the grand jury about his sexual 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L41><STRONG>A. Background</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>In January 1998, upon application of the Attorney General, the Special 
Division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit expanded the OIC's jurisdiction to investigate, among other matters, 
whether Monica Lewinsky and the President obstructed justice in the <U>Jones</U> 
case. The criminal investigation was triggered by specific and credible evidence 
that Monica Lewinsky denied her relationship with President Clinton in a false 
affidavit in the <U>Jones</U> case, that she had spoken to the President and 
Vernon Jordan about her testimony, and that she may have been influenced to lie 
by the President through the assistance of Vernon Jordan and others in finding 
her a job. After the President, in his January 17 deposition, denied any sexual 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and otherwise minimized his overall 
relationship with her, the President's testimony became an additional subject of 
the OIC investigation. 
<P>The threshold factual question was whether the President and Monica Lewinsky 
in fact had a sexual relationship. If they did, the President would have 
committed perjury in his civil deposition and interrogatory answer: The 
President, as noted in Ground I above, had denied a sexual affair, sexual 
relationship, or sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, including any direct 
contact with her breasts or genitalia. The answer to the preliminary factual 
question also could alter the interpretation of several possibly obstructionist 
acts by the President -- the employment assistance for Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the 
concealment of gifts he had given to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the discussion between 
the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky of her testimony or affidavit, the 
President's post-deposition communications with Betty Currie, and the 
President's emphatic denials of a relationship to his aides who later testified 
before the grand jury. 
<P>During the investigation, the OIC gathered a substantial body of information 
that established that the President and Monica Lewinsky did, in fact, have a 
sexual relationship. That information is outlined in Ground I above. In 
particular, the information includes: (i)&nbsp;the detailed and credible 
testimony of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky regarding the 10 sexual encounters; (ii)&nbsp;the 
President's semen stain on Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's dress; and (iii)&nbsp;the 
testimony of friends, family members, and counselors to whom she made 
near-contemporaneous statements about the relationship. All of this evidence 
pointed to a single conclusion -- that she and the President did have a sexual 
relationship. 
<P><A name=L42><STRONG>B. The President's Grand Jury Testimony</STRONG> 
<P>The President was largely aware of that extensive body of evidence before he 
testified to the grand jury on August 17, 1998. Not only did the President know 
that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had reached an immunity agreement with this Office in 
exchange for her truthful testimony, but the President knew from public reports 
and his own knowledge that his semen might be on one of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's 
dresses. The OIC had asked him for a blood sample on August 3, 1998 (two weeks 
before his grand jury testimony) and assured his counsel that there was a 
substantial predicate for the request, which reasonably implied that there was 
semen on the dress. 
<P>As a result, the President had three apparent choices in his testimony to the 
grand jury. <U>First</U>, the President could adhere to his previous testimony 
in his civil case, as well as in his public statements, and deny any sexual 
relationship. But he knew (or at least, had reason to know) that the contrary 
evidence was overwhelming, particularly if his semen were in fact on Ms. 
Lewinsky's dress. <U>Second</U>, the President could admit a sexual 
relationship, which would cause him also to simultaneously admit that he lied 
under oath in the <U>Jones</U> case. <U>Third</U>, the President could invoke 
his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. 
<P>Confronting those three options, the President attempted to avoid them 
altogether. The President admitted to an "inappropriate intimate" relationship, 
but he maintained that he had not committed perjury in the <U>Jones</U> case 
when he denied having a sexual relationship, sexual affair, or sexual relations 
with her.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_103_"><SUP>(103)</SUP></A> 
The President contended that he had believed his various statements in the 
<U>Jones</U> case to be legally accurate.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_104_"><SUP>(104)</SUP></A> 
He also testified that the inappropriate relationship began not in November 1995 
when Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was an intern, as Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and other witnesses 
have testified, but in 1996. 
<P>During his grand jury testimony, the President was asked whether Monica 
Lewinsky performed oral sex on him and, if so, whether he had committed perjury 
in his civil deposition by denying a sexual relationship, sexual affair, or 
sexual relations with her. The President refused to say whether he had oral sex. 
Instead, the President said (i)&nbsp;that the undefined terms "sexual affair," 
"sexual relationship," and "sexual relations" necessarily require sexual 
intercourse, (ii)&nbsp;that he had not engaged in intercourse with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, and (iii)&nbsp;that he therefore had not committed perjury in 
denying a sexual relationship, sexual affair, or sexual relations.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_105_"><SUP>(105)</SUP></A> 
<P>A more specific definition of "sexual relations" had also been used at the 
civil deposition. As to that definition, the President said to the grand jury 
that he does not and did not believe oral sex was covered. 
<P>Q: [I]s oral sex performed on you within that definition as you understood 
it, the definition in the Jones -- <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>A: As I understood it, it was not; no.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_106_"><SUP>(106)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President thus contended that he had not committed perjury on that 
question in the <U>Jones</U> deposition -- even assuming that Monica Lewinsky 
performed oral sex on him. 
<P>There still was the question of his contact with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts 
and genitalia, which the President conceded would fall within the <U>Jones</U> 
definition of sexual relations. The President denied that he had engaged in such 
activity and said, in effect, that Monica Lewinsky was lying: 
<P>Q: The question is, if Monica Lewinsky says that while you were in the Oval 
Office area you touched her breasts would she by lying? <BR wp="br1"><BR 
wp="br2">
<P>A: <U>That is not my recollection</U>. My recollection is that I did not have 
sexual relations with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and I'm staying on my former statement 
about that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My, my statement is that I did not have sexual 
relations as defined by that. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: If she says that you kissed her breasts, would she be lying? <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>A: I'm going to revert to my former statement [that is, the prepared 
statement denying "sexual relations"]. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Okay. If Monica Lewinsky says that while you were in the Oval Office area 
you touched her genitalia, would she be lying? And that calls for a yes, no, or 
reverting to your former statement. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>A: I will revert to my former statement on that.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_107_"><SUP>(107)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President elaborated that he considered kissing or touching breasts or 
genitalia during sexual activity to be covered by the <U>Jones</U> definition, 
but he denied that he had ever engaged in such conduct with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky:

<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L43><STRONG>C. Summary</STRONG> 
<P>In the foregoing testimony to the grand jury, the President lied under oath 
three times. 
<P>1. The President testified that he believed oral sex was not covered by 
<U>any</U> of the terms and definitions for sexual activity used at the 
<U>Jones</U> deposition. That testimony is not credible: At the <U>Jones</U> 
deposition, the President could not have believed that he was telling "the 
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth" in denying a sexual 
relationship, sexual relations, or a sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
<P>2. In all events, even putting aside his <U>definitional</U> defense, the 
President made a second false statement to the grand jury. The President's grand 
jury testimony contradicts Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's grand jury testimony on the 
question whether the President touched Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia 
during their sexual activity. There can be no contention that one of them has a 
lack of memory or is mistaken. On this issue, either Monica Lewinsky lied to the 
grand jury, or President Clinton lied to the grand jury. Under any rational view 
of the evidence, the President lied to the grand jury. 
<P><U>First</U>, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony about these encounters is 
detailed and specific. She described with precision nine incidents of sexual 
activity in which the President touched and kissed her breasts and four 
incidents involving contacts with her genitalia. 
<P><U>Second</U>, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky has stated repeatedly that she does not want 
to hurt the President by her testimony.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_109_"><SUP>(109)</SUP></A> 
Thus, if she had exaggerated in her many prior statements, she presumably would 
have said as much, rather than adhering to those statements. She has confirmed 
those details, however, even though it clearly has been painful for her to 
testify to the details of her relationship with the President. 
<P><U>Third</U>, the testimony of many of her friends, family members, and 
counselors corroborate her testimony in important detail. Many testified that 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had told them that the President had touched her breasts and 
genitalia during sexual activity. These statements were made well before the 
President's grand jury testimony rendered these precise details important. 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had no motive to lie to these individuals (and obviously not 
to counselors). Indeed, she pointed out to many of them that she was upset that 
sexual intercourse had not occurred, an unlikely admission if she were 
exaggerating the sexual aspects of their relationship. 
<P><U>Fourth</U>, a computer file obtained from Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's home 
computer contained a draft letter that referred in one place to their sexual 
relationship. The draft explicitly refers to "watching your mouth on my breast" 
and implicitly refers to direct contact with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's genitalia.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_110_"><SUP>(110)</SUP></A> 
This draft letter further corroborates Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony and 
indicates that the President's grand jury testimony is false. 
<P><U>Fifth</U>, as noted above, the President's "hands-off" scenario -- in 
which he would have received oral sex on nine occasions from Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
but never made direct contact with Ms. Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia -- is 
implausible. As Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky herself testified, it suggests that she and 
the President had some kind of "service contract -- that all I did was perform 
oral sex on him and that that's all this relationship was."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_111_"><SUP>(111)</SUP></A> 
But as the above descriptions and the Narrative explain, the nature of the 
relationship, including the sexual relationship, was far more than that. 
<P><U>Sixth</U>, in the grand jury, the President had a motive to lie by denying 
he had fondled Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in intimate ways. The President clearly sought 
to deny any acts that would show that he committed perjury in his civil case 
(implying that the President understood how seriously the public and the courts 
would view perjury in a civil case). To do that, the President had to deny 
touching Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia -- no matter how implausible 
his testimony to that effect might be. 
<P><U>Seventh</U>, the President refused to answer specific questions before the 
grand jury about what activity he did engage in (as opposed to what activity he 
did <U>not</U> engage in) -- even though at the <U>Jones</U> deposition only 
seven months before, his attorney stated that he was willing to answer specific 
questions when there was a sufficient factual predicate.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_112_"><SUP>(112)</SUP></A> 
The President's failure in the grand jury to answer specific follow-up questions 
suggests that he could not supply responses in a consistent or credible manner. 
<P>3. Finally, the President made a third false statement to the grand jury 
about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He contended that the 
intimate contact did not begin until 1996. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky has testified that 
it began November 15, 1995, during the government shutdown -- testimony 
corroborated by statements she made to friends at the time.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_113_"><SUP>(113)</SUP></A> A 
White House photograph of the evening shows the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
eating pizza.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_114_"><SUP>(114)</SUP></A> 
White House records show that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky did not depart the White House 
until 12:18 a.m. and show that the President was in the Oval Office area until 
12:35 a.m.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_115_"><SUP>(115)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was still an <U>intern</U> when she says the President 
began receiving oral sex from her, whereas she was a full-time employee by the 
time that the President admits they began an "inappropriate intimate" 
relationship. The motive for the President to make a false statement about the 
date on which the sexual relationship started appears to have been that the 
President was unwilling to admit sexual activity with a young 22-year-old White 
House <U>intern</U> in the Oval Office area. Indeed, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified 
that, at that first encounter, the President tugged at her intern pass. He said 
that "this" may be a problem; Ms. Lewinsky interpreted that statement to reflect 
his awareness that there would be a problem with her obtaining access to the 
West Wing.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_116_"><SUP>(116)</SUP></A> 
<P>For all these reasons, there is substantial and credible information that the 
President lied to the grand jury about his sexual relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky.<A

President Clinton lied under oath during his civil deposition when he stated

<P>
<P>The President testified to the grand jury and stated to the Nation on August 
17 that his testimony in his civil deposition had been "legally accurate." Even 
apart from his answers about the sexual relationship, the President's deposition 
testimony was inaccurate on several other points. 
<P>During President Clinton's deposition in the <U>Jones</U> case, 
Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys asked the President many detailed questions about the 
nature of his relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, apart from whether the 
relationship was sexual. The questions included: (i)&nbsp;whether the President 
had been alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in the White House and, if so, how many 
times; and (ii)&nbsp;whether he and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky exchanged gifts.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_118_"><SUP>(118)</SUP></A>

worked some on the weekends. Sometimes they'd bring me things on the weekends. 
She -- it seems to me she brought things to me once or twice on the weekends. In 
that case, whatever time she would be in there, drop it off, exchange a few 
words and go, she was there. I don't have any specific recollections of what the 
issues were, what was going on, but when the Congress is there, we're working 
all the time, and typically I would do some work on one of the days of the 
weekends in the afternoon. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">

were alone with her, but you have no specific recollection of that ever 
happening? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">

<P><A name=L48><STRONG>3. The President's Grand Jury Testimony </STRONG>
<P>On August 17, 1998, the President testified to the grand jury and began his 
testimony by reading a statement admitting that he had been alone with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky: 
<P><U>When I was alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on certain occasions in early 1996 
and once in early 1997</U>, I engaged in conduct that was wrong.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_144_"><SUP>(144)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President acknowledged being alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on multiple 
occasions, although he could not pinpoint the precise number.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_145_"><SUP>(145)</SUP></A> 
Perhaps most important, the President admitted that he was alone with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on December 28, 1997,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_146_"><SUP>(146)</SUP></A> 
<U>less than three weeks before his deposition in the Jones case</U>. Indeed, he 
acknowledged that he would have to have been an "exhibitionist" for him not to 
have been alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky when they were having sexual 
encounters.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_147_"><SUP>(147)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L49><STRONG>4. Summary</STRONG> 
<P>Substantial and credible information demonstrates that the President made 
three false statements under oath in his civil deposition regarding whether he 
had been alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. 
<P><U>First</U>, the President lied when he said "I don't recall" in response to 
the question whether he had ever been alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. The 
President admitted to the grand jury that he had been alone with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. It is not credible that he actually had no memory of this 
fact six months earlier, particularly given that they were obviously alone when 
engaging in sexual activity. 
<P><U>Second</U>, when asked whether he had been alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in 
the hallway in the Oval Office, the President answered, "I don't believe so, 
unless we were walking back to the back dining room with the pizza."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_148_"><SUP>(148)</SUP></A> 
That statement, too, was false: Most of the sexual encounters between the 
President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky occurred in that hallway (and on other 
occasions, they walked through the hallway to the dining room or study), and it 
is not credible that the President would have forgotten this fact. 
<P><U>Third</U>, the President suggested at his civil deposition that he had no 
specific recollection of being alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in the Oval Office, 
but had a general recollection that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky may have brought him 
"papers to sign" on certain occasions when she worked at the Legislative Affairs 
Office.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_149_"><SUP>(149)</SUP></A> 
This statement was false. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky did not bring him papers for 
official purposes. To the contrary, "bringing papers" was one of the sham "cover 
stories" that the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had originally crafted to 
conceal their sexual relationship.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_150_"><SUP>(150)</SUP></A> 
The fact that the President resorted to a previously designed cover story when 
testifying <U>under oath</U> at the <U>Jones</U>&nbsp;deposition confirms that 
he made these false denials in a calculated manner with the intent and knowledge 
that they were false. 
<P>The President had an obvious motive to lie in this respect. He knew that it 
would appear odd for a President to have been alone with a female intern or 
low-level staffer on so many occasions. Such an admission might persuade Judge 
Wright to deny any motion by Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to quash her deposition subpoena. 
It also might prompt Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys to oppose efforts by 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky not to be deposed and to ask specific questions of 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about the times she was alone with the President. It also 
might raise questions publicly if and when the President's deposition became 
public; at least parts of the deposition were likely to become public at trial, 
if not at the summary judgment stage. 
<P>Because lying about their sexual relationship was insufficient to avoid 
raising further questions, the President also lied about being alone with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky -- or at least feigned lack of memory as to specific 
occurrences.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_151_"><SUP>(151)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L50><STRONG>B. There is substantial and credible information that the 
President lied under oath in his civil deposition about gifts he exchanged with 
Monica Lewinsky.</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>During his civil deposition, the President also was asked several questions 
about gifts he and Monica Lewinsky had exchanged. The evidence demonstrates that 
he answered the questions falsely. As with the questions about being alone, 
truthful answers to these questions would have raised questions about the nature 
of the relationship. Such answers also would have been inconsistent with the 
understanding of the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that, in response to her 
subpoena, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would not produce all of the gifts she had received 
from the President (an issue discussed more fully in Ground V).

The President's attorney, David E. Kendall, stated in a letter on March 16,

Ms. Lewinsky testified that on December 6, 1997, and possibly again on December

He acknowledged giving her gifts on December 28, 1997,<A

just three weeks before the civil deposition. 
<P>During the criminal investigation, the President has produced seven gifts 
that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky gave him. He testified to the grand jury that 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had given him "a tie, a coffee cup, a <U>number of other 
things I had</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_184_"><SUP>(184)</SUP></A> 
In addition, the President acknowledged that "there were some things that had 
been in my possession that I no longer had, I believe."<A

<P>Betty Currie testified that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky sent a number of packages for 
the President -- six or eight, she estimated.<A

Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky also sometimes dropped parcels off or had family members do 
so.<A

When the packages came to the White House, Ms.&nbsp;Currie would leave the

and "[h]e would pick [them] up."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_188_"><SUP>(188)</SUP></A> 
To the best of her knowledge, such parcels always reached the President: "The 
President got everything anyone sent him."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_189_"><SUP>(189)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie testified that to her knowledge, no one delivered packages or 
something as many times as Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky did.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_190_"><SUP>(190)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L57><STRONG>6. Summary </STRONG>
<P>The President stated in his civil deposition that he could not recall whether 
he had ever given any gifts to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky;<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_191_"><SUP>(191)</SUP></A> 
that he could not remember whether he had given her a hat pin although 
"certainly, I could have"; and that he had received a gift from 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky only "once or twice."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_192_"><SUP>(192)</SUP></A> 
In fact, the evidence demonstrates that they exchanged numerous gifts of various 
kinds at many points over a lengthy period of time. Indeed, on December 28, only 
three weeks before the deposition, they had discussed the hat pin. Also on 
December 28, the President had given Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky a number of gifts, more 
than he had ever given her before. 
<P>A truthful answer to the questions about gifts at the <U>Jones</U> deposition 
would have raised further questions about the President's relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. The number itself would raise questions about the relationship 
and prompt further questions about specific gifts; some of the specific gifts 
(such as <U>Vox</U>&nbsp;and <U>Leaves of Grass</U>) would raise questions 
whether the relationship was sexual and whether the President had lied in 
denying that their relationship was sexual. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky explained the 
point: Had they admitted the gifts, it would "at least prompt [the <U>Jones</U> 
attorneys] to want to question me about what kind of friendship I had with the 
President and they would want to speculate and they'd leak it and my name would 
be trashed and he [the President] would be in trouble."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_193_"><SUP>(193)</SUP></A> 
<P>A truthful answer about the gifts to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky also would have raised 
the question of where they were. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had been subpoenaed for 
gifts, as the President knew. The President knew also from his conversation with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on December 28, 1997 (an issue discussed more fully in Ground 
V) that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would not produce all of the gifts she had received 
from the President. 
<P>For those reasons, the President had a clear motive when testifying under 
oath to lie about the gifts.

<P>
<P><A name=L62><STRONG>(i) Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's Testimony</STRONG> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she spoke <U>three times</U> to President

(December 17, 1997) after she was on the witness list and twice more (December 
28, 1997, and January 5, 1998) after she had been subpoenaed. 
<P>a. <U>December 17, 1997, Call</U>. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that President 
Clinton called her at about 2:00 a.m. on December 17, 1997. First, he told her 
that Ms.&nbsp;Currie's brother had died; then he told Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that she 
was on the witness list in the <U>Jones</U> case. According to 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, "[h]e told me that it didn't necessarily mean that I would be 
subpoenaed, but that that was a possibility, and if I were to be subpoenaed, 
that I should contact Betty and let Betty know that I had received the 
subpoena."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_195_"><SUP>(195)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said that the President told her that she might be able to 
sign an affidavit to avoid being deposed.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_196_"><SUP>(196)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the President also told her, "<U>You know, you 
can always say you were coming to see Betty or that you were bringing me 
letters</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_197_"><SUP>(197)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky took that statement to be a reminder of the false "cover

<P>b. <U>December 28, 1997, Visit</U>. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was subpoenaed on 
December 19. At her request, Vernon Jordan told the President that 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had been subpoenaed.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_199_"><SUP>(199)</SUP></A> 
She then met with President Clinton nine days later on December 28, less than 
three weeks before the President was deposed. 
<P>According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, she and the President discussed the 
<U>Jones</U> lawsuit and how the <U>Jones</U> lawyers might have learned about 
her. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said they also discussed the subpoena's requirement that 
she produce gifts she had received from the President, including specifically a 
"hat pin."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_200_"><SUP>(200)</SUP></A> 
<P>Because of their mutual concern about the subpoena, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
testified that she asked the President if she should put the gifts away 
somewhere.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_201_"><SUP>(201)</SUP></A> 
The President responded "I don't know" or "Hmm" or "Let me think about it."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_202_"><SUP>(202)</SUP></A> 
Later that day, according to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, Ms.&nbsp;Currie called to pick 
up the gifts, which she then stored under her bed in her home in Virginia.<A

(This issue will be discussed more fully in Ground&nbsp;V below.) 
<P>c. <U>January 5, 1998, Call</U>. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky also testified that she 
spoke to the President by telephone on January 5, 1998, and they continued to 
discuss her role in the <U>Jones</U> case. Ms. Lewinsky expressed concern that, 
if she were deposed, she might have a difficult time explaining the 
circumstances of her transfer from the White House to the Pentagon. According to 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the President suggested that she answer by explaining that 
people in the White House Legislative Affairs office had helped her get the 
Pentagon job -- which Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky understood to be a misleading answer 
because she in fact had been transferred as a result of her being around the 
Oval Office too much.<A

<P><U>She raised the issue with me in the context of her desire to avoid

<P><A name=L64><STRONG>3. Summary</STRONG> 
<P>There is substantial and credible information that President Clinton lied 
under oath in his civil deposition in answering "I'm not sure" when asked 
whether he had talked to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about the prospect of her testifying. 
In fact, he had talked to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about it on three occasions in the 
month preceding his civil deposition, as Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony makes 
clear. 
<P>The President's motive to lie in his civil deposition on this point is 
evident. Had he admitted talking to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about the possibility that 
she might be asked to testify, that would have raised the specter of witness 
tampering. Such an admission likely would have led Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys to 
inquire further into that subject with both the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. 
Furthermore, had the President admitted talking to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about her 
testifying, that conversation would have attracted public inquiry into the 
conversation and the general relationship between the President and 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. 
<P><A name=L65><STRONG>B. There is substantial and credible information that

<P><A name=L66><STRONG>1. Evidence</STRONG> 
<P>In his civil deposition, President Clinton testified that the last time he

deposition), "[p]robably sometime before Christmas."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_208_"><SUP>(208)</SUP></A> 
The President was asked: 
<P>Q: Did [Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky] tell you she had been served with a subpoena in 
this case? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: No. <U>I don't know if she had been</U>.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_209_"><SUP>(209)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Vernon Jordan testified that he had told the President about the subpoena on 
December 19, 1997, after he had talked to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
confirmed that Mr.&nbsp;Jordan had told her on December 22, 1997, that he 
(Mr.&nbsp;Jordan) had told the President of her subpoena.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_210_"><SUP>(210)</SUP></A> 
<P>When he testified to the grand jury, the President stated that in his 
conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on December 28, 1997, "my recollection is 
<U>I knew by then, of course, that she had gotten a subpoena</U>. And I knew 
that she was, therefore, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. slated to testify."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_211_"><SUP>(211)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she and the President had two conversations 
after she was subpoenaed: the December 28, 1997, meeting and a January 5, 1998, 
phone conversation.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_212_"><SUP>(212)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L67><STRONG>2. Summary</STRONG> 
<P>There is substantial and credible information that the President lied under 
oath in his civil deposition by answering "I don't know if she had been" 
subpoenaed when describing his last conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. In 
fact, he knew that she had been subpoenaed. Given that the conversation with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky occurred in the few weeks immediately before the President's 
civil deposition, he could not have forgotten the conversation. As a result, 
there is no plausible conclusion except that the President intentionally lied in 
this answer. 
<P>During the civil deposition, the President also falsely dated his last 
conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky as "probably sometime before Christmas," 
which implied that it might have been before the December 19 subpoena. Because 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had been subpoenaed on December 19, that false statement about 
the date of the conversation was a corollary to his other false statement (that 
he did not know she had been subpoenaed at the time of their last conversation). 

<P>The President's motive to lie in his civil deposition on the subpoena issue 
is evident. Had he admitted talking to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky <U>after</U> her 
subpoena, that would have raised the specter of witness tampering, which could 
have triggered legal and public scrutiny of the President. 
<P><A name=L68><STRONG>V. There is substantial and credible information that 
President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by engaging in a pattern of 
activity to conceal evidence regarding his relationship with Monica Lewinsky 
from the judicial process in the <U>Jones</U> case. The pattern included: 
</STRONG><BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">

the President on January 5, 1998. </STRONG>
<P><A name=L71><STRONG><EM></STRONG></EM>
<P><EM></EM>From the beginning, President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky hoped and 
expected that their relationship would remain secret. They took active steps, 
when necessary, to conceal the relationship. The President testified that "I 
hoped that this relationship would never become public."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_213_"><SUP>(213)</SUP></A> 
<P>Once the discovery process in the <U>Jones</U> case became an issue 
(particularly after the Supreme Court's unanimous decision on May 27, 1997, that 
ordered the case to go forward), their continuing efforts to conceal the 
relationship took on added legal significance. The risks to the President of 
disclosure of the relationship dramatically increased. 
<P>An effort to obstruct justice by withholding the truth from the legal process 
-- whether by lying under oath, concealing documents, or improperly influencing 
a witness's testimony -- is a federal crime.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_214_"><SUP>(214)</SUP></A> 
There is substantial and credible information that President Clinton engaged in 
such efforts to prevent the truth of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky from

Among other subjects, the President mentioned that he had Christmas presents for 
her.<A

<P>On December 19, 1997, Monica Lewinsky was served with a subpoena in

The subpoena also required Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to produce "each and every gift

and/or hat pins given to you by, or on behalf of, Defendant Clinton."<A

<P>Later that same day, December 19, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met with Vernon

concerned about the hat pin being on the subpoena and he said that that had sort 
of concerned him also and asked [her] if [she] had told anyone that he had given 
[her] this hat pin and [she] said no."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_225_"><SUP>(225)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, she and the President discussed the possibility 
of moving some of the gifts out of her possession: 
<P>[A]t some point I said to him, "Well, you know, should I -- maybe I should 
put the gifts away outside my house somewhere or give them to someone, maybe 
Betty." And he sort of said -- I think he responded, "I don't know" or "Let me 
think about that." And [we] left that topic.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_226_"><SUP>(226)</SUP></A> 
<P>
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that she was never under the impression from anything 
the President said that she should turn over to Ms. Jones's attorneys all the 
gifts that he had given her.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_227_"><SUP>(227)</SUP></A> 
<P>On the 28th, the President also gave Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky several Christmas 
gifts. When asked why the President gave her more gifts on December 28 when he 
understood she was under an obligation to produce gifts in response to the 
subpoena, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky stated: 
<P>You know, I can't answer what [the President] was thinking, but to me, it was 
-- there was never a question in my mind and I -- <U>from everything he said to 
me</U>, I never questioned him, that we were never going to do anything but keep 
this private, so that meant deny it and that meant do -- take whatever 
appropriate steps needed to be taken, you know, for that to happen 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So by turning over all these gifts, it would at least 
prompt [the <U>Jones</U> attorneys] to want to question me about what kind of 
friendship I had with the President and they would want to speculate and they'd 
leak it and my name would be trashed and he [the President] would be in 
trouble.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_228_"><SUP>(228)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that a few hours after their meeting on December 
28, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Currie called her.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_229_"><SUP>(229)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, Ms.&nbsp;Currie said: "'I understand you have 
something to give me.' Or, 'The President said you have something to give me' -- 
[Something] [a]long those lines."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_230_"><SUP>(230)</SUP></A> 
In her February 1 handwritten statement to the OIC, which Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky has 
testified was truthful, she stated: "Ms.&nbsp;Currie called Ms.&nbsp;L later 
that afternoon a[nd] said that <U>the Pres. had told her</U> [that] Ms.&nbsp;L 
wanted her to hold onto something for her. Ms.&nbsp;L boxed up most of the gifts 
she had received and gave them to Ms.&nbsp;Currie."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_231_"><SUP>(231)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she understood that Ms.&nbsp;Currie was 
referring to gifts from the President when she mentioned "something for me."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_232_"><SUP>(232)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she was not surprised to receive the call, 
given her earlier discussion with the President.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_233_"><SUP>(233)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Currie testified that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, not Ms.&nbsp;Currie, placed 
the call and raised the subject of transferring the gifts. In Ms.&nbsp;Currie's 
account, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said that she (Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky) was uncomfortable 
retaining the gifts herself because "people were asking questions about the 
stuff she had gotten."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_234_"><SUP>(234)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie also testified that she did not remember the President telling 
her that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky wanted her to hold some items, and she did not 
remember later telling the President that she was holding the gifts for 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_235_"><SUP>(235)</SUP></A> 
When asked if a contrary statement by Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky -- indicating that 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie had in fact spoken to the President about the gift transfer -- 
would be false, Ms.&nbsp;Currie replied: "<U>Then she may remember better than 
I. I don't remember</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_236_"><SUP>(236)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to both Ms.&nbsp;Currie and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, Ms.&nbsp;Currie 
drove to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's home later on December 28 for only the second time 
in her life.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_237_"><SUP>(237)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky gave her a sealed box that contained several gifts 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had received from the President, including the hat pin and one 
of the gifts he had given her that very morning.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_238_"><SUP>(238)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky wrote "Please do not throw away" on the box.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_239_"><SUP>(239)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie then took the box and placed it in her home under her bed. 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie understood that the box contained gifts from the President, 
although she did not know the specific contents.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_240_"><SUP>(240)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky said that Ms. Currie did not seem at all confused when Ms. Lewinsky 
handed over the box of gifts<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_241_"><SUP>(241)</SUP></A> 
and never asked about the contents.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_242_"><SUP>(242)</SUP></A> 
<P>When Ms.&nbsp;Currie later produced the box to the OIC in response to a 
subpoena, the box contained a hat pin, two brooches, an inscribed official copy 
of the 1996 State of the Union Address, a photograph of the President in the 
Oval Office, an inscribed photograph of the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, a 
sun dress, two t-shirts, and a baseball cap with a Black Dog logo.<A

<P><A name=L74><STRONG>2. The President's Grand Jury Testimony</STRONG> 
<P>President Clinton testified that he had spoken to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about 
gifts he had given her, but said the conversation may have occurred 
<U>before</U> she received the subpoena on December 19. He testified: 
<P><U>I did have a conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky at some time about gifts, 
the gifts I'd given her.</U> I do not know whether it occurred on the 28th, or 
whether it occurred earlier. I do not know whether it occurred in person or 
whether it occurred on the telephone. I have searched my memory for this, 
because I know it's an important issue.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The reason I'm not 
sure it happened on the 28th is that my recollection is that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
said something to me like, what if they ask me about the gifts you've given me. 
That's the memory I have. That's why I question whether it happened on the 28th, 
because she had a subpoena with her, request for production. <U>And I told her 
that if they asked her for gifts, she'd have to give them whatever she had, that 
that's what the law was.</U><A

<P><A name=L75><STRONG>3. Summary of Gifts</STRONG> 
<P>The uncontroverted evidence demonstrates that the President had given gifts 
to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky before December 28, 1997; that the President told 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on the phone on December 17, 1997, that he had more gifts for 
her; that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met with the President at the White House on 
December 28; that on the 28th, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was concerned about retaining 
possession of the gifts the President had previously given her because they were 
under subpoena; that on the 28th, the President gave several Christmas gifts to 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky; and that after that meeting, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky transferred 
some gifts (including one of the new gifts) to the President's personal 
secretary, Ms.&nbsp;Currie, who stored them under her bed in her home. 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she spoke to the President on December 28 
about the gifts called for by the subpoena -- in particular, the hat pin. The 
President agreed that they talked about gifts, but suggested that the 
conversation might have taken place before Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was subpoenaed on 
December 19. The President said, however, that his memory is unclear on the 
timing.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_247_"><SUP>(247)</SUP></A> 
<P>The testimony conflicts as to what happened when Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky raised the 
subject of gifts with the President and what happened later that day. The 
President testified that he told Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that "you have to give them 
whatever you have."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_248_"><SUP>(248)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, she raised the possibility of hiding the gifts, 
and the President offered a somewhat neutral response. 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that Betty Currie called her to retrieve the 
gifts soon after Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's conversation with the President. 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie says that she believes that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky called her about 
the gifts, but she says she has a dim memory of the events.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_249_"><SUP>(249)</SUP></A> 
<P>The central factual question is whether the President orchestrated or 
approved the concealment of the gifts. The reasonable inference from the 
evidence is that he did. 
<P>1. The witnesses disagree about whether Ms.&nbsp;Currie called 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky or Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky called Ms.&nbsp;Currie. That issue is 
relevant because Ms.&nbsp;Currie would not have called Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky about 
the gifts unless the President directed her to do so. Indeed, because she did 
not know of the gifts issue, there is no other way that Ms.&nbsp;Currie could 
have known to make such a call unless the President told her to do so. 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony on the issue is consistent and unequivocal. In 
her February 1, 1998, handwritten statement, she wrote: "Ms.&nbsp;Currie called 
Ms.&nbsp;L later that afternoon a[nd] said that <U>the Pres. had told her</U> 
Ms.&nbsp;L wanted her to hold onto something for her."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_250_"><SUP>(250)</SUP></A> 
In her grand jury testimony, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said that several hours after she 
left the White House, Ms.&nbsp;Currie called and said something along the lines 
of "The President said you have something to give me."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_251_"><SUP>(251)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Currie's testimony is contrary but less clear. Ms.&nbsp;Currie has 
stated that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky called her, but her memory of the conversation, in 
contrast to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's, generally has been hazy and uncertain. As to 
whether she had talked to the President about the gifts, for example, 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie initially said she had not, but then said that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
(who said that Ms.&nbsp;Currie <U>had</U> talked to the President) "may remember 
better than I. I don't remember."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_252_"><SUP>(252)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony makes more sense than Ms.&nbsp;Currie's 
testimony. First, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky stated that if Ms.&nbsp;Currie had not 
called, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky simply would have kept the gifts (and perhaps thrown 
them away).<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_253_"><SUP>(253)</SUP></A> 
She would not have produced the gifts to Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys. And she 
would <U>not</U> have given them to a friend or mother because she did not want 
to get anyone else involved.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_254_"><SUP>(254)</SUP></A> 
She was not looking for someone else to take them.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_255_"><SUP>(255)</SUP></A> 
<P>Also, Ms.&nbsp;Currie drove to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's house to pick up the 
gifts. That was only the second time that Ms.&nbsp;Currie had ever gone there.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_256_"><SUP>(256)</SUP></A> 
More generally, the person making the extra effort (in this case, 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie) is ordinarily the person requesting the favor. 
<P>2. Even if Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky is mistaken and she did call Ms.&nbsp;Currie 
first, the evidence still leads clearly to the conclusion that the President 
orchestrated this transfer. 
<P><U>First</U>, it is unlikely that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would have involved 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie in this matter unless the President had indicated his assent 
when Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky raised the issue with him earlier in the day. Indeed, 
there is a logical flaw in the President's story: If the President had truly 
suggested that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky produce the gifts to Ms.&nbsp;Jones's 
attorneys, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky obviously would not have turned around and called 
the President's personal secretary to give the gifts to her, in direct 
contravention of the President's instruction. 
<P><U>Second</U>, it also is unlikely that Ms.&nbsp;Currie would have driven to 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's home, retrieved the gifts from Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, and stored 
them under her bed at home without being asked to do so by the President -- at 
least, without checking with him. It would have been out of character for 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie to have taken such an action without the President's approval. 
For example, when helping Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in her job search, Ms.&nbsp;Currie 
said that she told the President of her plans and agreed that she "would not 
have tried to get Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky a job if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [I] thought the 
President didn't want [me] to."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_257_"><SUP>(257)</SUP></A> 
<P>3. Even if the President did not orchestrate the <U>transfer</U> to 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie, there is still substantial evidence that he encouraged the 
<U>concealment</U> and <U>non-production</U> of the gifts by Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. 
The President "hoped that this relationship would never become public."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_258_"><SUP>(258)</SUP></A> 
The President gave Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky new gifts on December 28, 1997. Given his 
desire to conceal the relationship, it makes no sense that the President would 
have given Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky more gifts on the 28th unless he and 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky understood that she would <U>not</U> produce all of her gifts 
in response to her subpoena. 
<P>4. The President had a motive to orchestrate the concealment of gifts, 
whether accomplished through Ms.&nbsp;Currie indirectly or through 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky directly. The President knew that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was 
concerned about the subpoena. Both of them were concerned that the gifts might 
raise questions about the relationship. By confirming that the gifts would not 
be produced, the President ensured that these questions would not arise. 
<P>The concealment of the gifts also ensured that the President could provide 
false and misleading statements about the gifts under oath at his deposition (as 
he did) without being concerned that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky might have produced gifts 
that the President was denying (or minimizing the number of). If 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had produced to Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys all of the gifts 
that she had given to Ms.&nbsp;Currie, then the President could not plausibly 
have said "I don't recall" in response to the question, "[H]ave you ever given 
any gifts to Monica Lewinsky?" He could not have said, "I don't remember a 
specific gift."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_259_"><SUP>(259)</SUP></A> 
Indeed, unless the President knew that Ms. Lewinsky had not complied with the 
subpoena, it is unlikely he would have risked lying about the number and nature 
of the gifts he had given her. 
<P>In analyzing the evidence on this issue, it also bears mention that President 
Clinton likely operated no differently with respect to the gifts than he did 
with respect to testimony. It is clear that he lied under oath and that 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky filed a false affidavit after the President suggested she file 
an affidavit. So there is little reason that he would not have attempted to 
ensure (whether directly or subtly) that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky conceal the gifts as 
a corollary to their mutual lies under oath. (Also, it was the President's 
pattern to use Ms.&nbsp;Currie as an intermediary in dealing with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_260_"><SUP>(260)</SUP></A>) 
<P>The President's apparent response to all of this is that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
<U>on her own</U> contacted Ms.&nbsp;Currie and involved her in this endeavor to 
hide subpoenaed evidence, and that Ms.&nbsp;Currie complied without checking 
with the President. Based on the testimony and behavior of both Ms.&nbsp;Currie 
and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, those inferences fall outside the range of reasonable 
possibility. 
<P>There is substantial and credible information, therefore, that the President 
endeavored to obstruct justice by participating in the concealment of subpoenaed 
evidence.

<P><A name=L77><STRONG>1. Evidence Regarding the January 5, 1998 Note</STRONG> 
<P>On December 16, 1997, the President was served by Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys 
with a request for production of documents, including documents relating to 
"Monica Lewisky" [sic]. The request placed upon the President a continuing 
obligation to preserve and produce responsive documents. Notes and letters from 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky were responsive and relevant. 
<P>On January 4, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky left a book for the President with 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_261_"><SUP>(261)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had enclosed in the book a romantic note that she had written, 
inspired by a recent viewing of the movie <U>Titanic</U>.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_262_"><SUP>(262)</SUP></A> 
In the note, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky told the President that she wanted to have sexual 
intercourse with him, at least once.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_263_"><SUP>(263)</SUP></A> 
<P>On January 5, in the course of discussing her affidavit and possible 
testimony in a phone conversation with the President, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky says she 
told the President, "I shouldn't have written some of those things in the 
note."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_264_"><SUP>(264)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the President said that he agreed and that she 
should not write those kinds of things on paper.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_265_"><SUP>(265)</SUP></A> 
<P>On January 15, President Clinton served responses to Ms.&nbsp;Jones's second 
set of document requests, which again asked for documents that related to 
"Monica Lewisky." The President stated that he had "no documents" responsive to 
this request.<A

<P><A name=L78><STRONG>2. President Clinton's Testimony</STRONG>

<P><A name=L79><STRONG>3. Summary on January 5, 1998, Note</STRONG> 
<P>The request for production of documents that the President received from 
Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys called for all documents reflecting communications 
between him and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. The note given to him by Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on 
January 5, 1998, fell within that category and would have been revealing about 
the relationship. Indeed, had the note been produced, the President might have 
been foreclosed from denying a sexual relationship at his deposition. Based on 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony, there is substantial and credible information 
that the President concealed or destroyed this note at a time when such 
documents were called for by the request for production of documents.<A

<P>Based on their conversations and their past practice, both the President and

the <U>Jones</U> case. In pursuing this effort: 
<P>the President suggested that Monica Lewinsky file an affidavit, which he knew 
would be false; <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>the President had an interest in Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's false affidavit because

<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky signed and, on January 16, sent to the Court the false 
affidavit denying a sexual relationship with the President as part of a motion

<P>the President's attorney used the affidavit to object to questions about

<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky understood the President's advice to mean that she might be 
able to execute an affidavit that would not disclose the true nature of their

<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky has stated that the President never <U>explicitly</U> told

conversations that they would continue their pattern of covering up and lying 
about the relationship. In that regard, the President never said they must now 
tell the truth under oath; to the contrary, as Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky stated: 
<P>[I]t wasn't as if the President called me and said, "You know, Monica, you're 
on the witness list, this is going to be really hard for us, we're going to have 
to tell the truth and be humiliated in front of the entire world about what

<P>Ms.&nbsp;Jones's lawyers served Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky with a subpoena on December

Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, the President replied that he did not need to see it because 
he had already "seen 15 others."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_279_"><SUP>(279)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Jordan confirmed that President Clinton knew that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
planned to execute an affidavit denying a sexual relationship.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_280_"><SUP>(280)</SUP></A> 
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan further testified that he informed President Clinton when 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky signed the affidavit.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_281_"><SUP>(281)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's affidavit was sent to the federal court in Arkansas on 
January 16, 1998 -- the day before the President's deposition -- as part of her 
motion to quash the deposition subpoena. 
<P>Two days before the President's deposition, his lawyer, Robert Bennett, 
obtained a copy of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's affidavit from Mr.&nbsp;Carter.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_282_"><SUP>(282)</SUP></A> 
At the President's deposition, Ms.&nbsp;Jones's counsel asked questions about 
the President's relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. Mr.&nbsp;Bennett objected 
to the "innuendo" of the questions, noting that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had signed an 
affidavit denying a sexual relationship, which according to Mr.&nbsp;Bennett, 
indicated that "<U>there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape 
or form</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_283_"><SUP>(283)</SUP></A> 
Mr.&nbsp;Bennett said that the President was "fully aware of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's 
affidavit."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_284_"><SUP>(284)</SUP></A> 
Mr.&nbsp;Bennett affirmatively used the affidavit in an effort to cut off 
questioning. The President said nothing -- even though, as he knew, the 
affidavit was false. Judge Wright overruled the objection and allowed the 
questioning to continue. 
<P>Later, Mr.&nbsp;Bennett read Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's affidavit denying a "sexual 
relationship" to the President and asked him: "Is that a true and accurate 
statement as far as you know it?" The President answered: "<U>That is absolutely 
true</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_285_"><SUP>(285)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L84><STRONG>B. Summary of President's Grand Jury Testimony</STRONG> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President told the grand jury: "[D]id I hope [Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would] be 
able to get out of testifying on an affidavit? Absolutely. Did I want her to 
execute a false affidavit? No, I did not."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_286_"><SUP>(286)</SUP></A> 
The President did not explain how a full and truthful affidavit -- for example, 
an affidavit admitting that they engaged in oral sex and that Vernon Jordan had 
been involved, at the President's request, in late 1997 and early 1998 in 
obtaining Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky a job -- would have helped her avoid a deposition. 
<P>When questioned about his phone conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky on 
December 17, 1997 -- during which the President suggested filing an affidavit -- 
the President testified that he did not remember exactly what he had said.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_287_"><SUP>(287)</SUP></A> 
The President also maintained that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's affidavit, as it 
ultimately was filed denying a "sexual relationship," was not necessarily 
inaccurate. He testified that, depending on Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's state of mind, 
her statement denying a sexual relationship could have been true. 
<P>I believe at the time that she filled out this affidavit, <U>if she believed 
that the definition of sexual relationship was two people having intercourse, 
then this is accurate. And I believe that is the definition that most ordinary 
Americans would give it</U>.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_288_"><SUP>(288)</SUP></A> 
<P>
<P>At his grand jury appearance, the President also was asked about his 
counsel's statement to Judge Wright that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's affidavit denying a 
"sexual relationship" was equivalent to saying "there is absolutely no sex of 
any kind in any manner, shape or form" with President Clinton. Given the 
President's interpretation of the term "sexual relationship" to require sexual 
intercourse, the President was asked how he lawfully could have sat silent while 
his attorney -- in the President's presence and on his behalf -- made a false 
statement to a United States District Judge in an effort to forestall further 
questioning. The President offered several responses. 
<P>First, the President maintained that he was not paying "much attention" when 
Mr.&nbsp;Bennett said that there is "absolutely no sex of any kind" between the 
President and Ms. Lewinsky."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_289_"><SUP>(289)</SUP></A> 
The President further stated: "That moment, that whole argument just passed me 
by. I was a witness."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_290_"><SUP>(290)</SUP></A> 
The President's explanation is difficult to reconcile with the videotape of the 
deposition, which shows that the President was looking in Mr.&nbsp;Bennett's 
direction when his counsel made this statement. 
<P>Alternatively, the President contended that when Mr.&nbsp;Bennett said that 
"there <U>is</U> absolutely no sex of any kind," Mr.&nbsp;Bennett was speaking 
only in the present tense and thus was making a completely true statement. The 
President further stated: <U>"It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' 
is</U>,"<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_291_"><SUP>(291)</SUP></A> 
and that "actually, in the present tense that is an accurate statement."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_292_"><SUP>(292)</SUP></A> 
Before the grand jury, counsel for the OIC then asked the President: "Do you 
mean today that because you were not engaging in sexual activity with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky during the deposition that the statement of Mr.&nbsp;Bennett 
might be literally true?"<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_293_"><SUP>(293)</SUP></A> 
The President responded: "No, sir. I mean that at the time of the deposition, it 
had been -- that was well beyond any point of improper contact between me and 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_294_"><SUP>(294)</SUP></A> 
The President's suggestion that he might have engaged in such a detailed parsing 
of the words at his deposition is at odds with his assertion that the "whole 
argument passed me by." 
<P>Finally, the President took issue with the notion that he had any duty to 
prevent his attorney from making a false statement to Judge Wright: 
"Mr.&nbsp;Bennett was representing me. I wasn't representing him."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_295_"><SUP>(295)</SUP></A> 
That is a truism. Yet when a witness is knowingly responsible for a misstatement 
of fact to a federal judge that misleads the Court and attempts to prevent 
questioning on a relevant subject, that conduct rises to the level of an 
obstruction of justice. 
<P><A name=L85><STRONG>C. Evidence Regarding Cover Stories</STRONG> 
<P>The affidavit was not the only part of the scheme in which both the President 
and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would lie under oath. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that, as 
part of their mutual concealment efforts, she and President Clinton formulated 
"cover stories" to explain Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's presence in the West Wing and 
Oval Office. When Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky worked at the White House, she and the 
President agreed that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would tell people that she was coming to 
the Oval Office to deliver papers or to have papers signed, when in truth she 
was going to the Oval Office to have a sexual encounter with the President.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_296_"><SUP>(296)</SUP></A> 
<P>While employed at the White House, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky used this cover story on 
several occasions.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_297_"><SUP>(297)</SUP></A> 
It worked: Several Secret Service officers testified that they understood that 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was at the Oval Office to deliver or to pick up papers.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_298_"><SUP>(298)</SUP></A> 
In fact, however, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky stated that her White House job never 
required her to deliver papers or obtain the President's signature, although she 
carried papers as a prop.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_299_"><SUP>(299)</SUP></A> 
<P>After she was transferred to the Pentagon, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that 
she and the President formulated a second "cover story": that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
was going to the White House to visit Betty Currie rather than the President. 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she and the President discussed how "Betty 
always needed to be the one to clear me in so that, you know, I could always say 
I was coming to see Betty."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_300_"><SUP>(300)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that she met with the President privately on ten 
occasions after she left her job at the White House.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_301_"><SUP>(301)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie signed her in for each of those private visits.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_302_"><SUP>(302)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky has stated that her true purpose in visiting the White 
House on these occasions was to see President Clinton, not Ms.&nbsp;Currie.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_303_"><SUP>(303)</SUP></A> 
President Clinton agreed that "just about every time" that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
came to see Ms.&nbsp;Currie when he was there, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky saw him as 
well.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_304_"><SUP>(304)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that President Clinton encouraged her to continue 
to use the cover stories to conceal their relationship <U>after</U> her name 
appeared on the witness list in the <U>Jones</U> case. In her early-morning 
phone conversation with President Clinton on December 17, 1997 -- the same 
conversation in which the President told her that her name was on the witness 
list and suggested that she file an affidavit if subpoenaed<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_305_"><SUP>(305)</SUP></A> 
-- Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky discussed cover stories with the President: 
<P>ML: At some point in the conversation, and I don't know if it was before or 
after the subject of the affidavit came up, he sort of said, <U>"You know, you 
can always say you were coming to see Betty or that you were bringing me 
letters." Which I understood was really a reminder of things that we had 
discussed before.</U> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: So when you say things you had discussed, sort of ruses that you had 
developed. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>ML: Right. I mean, this was -- this was something that -- that was instantly 
familiar to me. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Right. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>ML: <U>And I knew exactly what he meant.</U> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Had you talked with him earlier about these false explanations about what 
you were doing visiting him on several occasions? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>ML: Several occasions throughout the entire relationship. Yes. <U>It was the 
pattern of the relationship, to sort of conceal it</U>.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_306_"><SUP>(306)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>President Clinton used those same deceptive cover stories during his 
deposition in the <U>Jones</U> case. In the civil deposition, when asked if he 
had met with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky "several times" while she worked at the White 
House, the President responded that he had seen her on two or three occasions 
during the government shutdown, "and then when she worked at the White House, I 
think there was one or two other times <U>when she brought some documents to 
me</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_307_"><SUP>(307)</SUP></A> 
When asked if he was ever alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in the Oval Office, the 
President stated: 
<P>[W]hen she worked at the legislative affairs office, they always had somebody 
there on the weekends.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <U>Sometimes they'd bring me things 
on the weekends</U>. In that case, whatever time she would be in there, drop it 
off, exchange a few words and go, she was there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It's 
possible that she, in, while she was working there, brought something to me and 
that at the time she brought it to me, she was the only person there, That's 
possible.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_308_"><SUP>(308)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The pattern of devising cover stories in an effort to forestall an inquiry 
into the relationship continued even after Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was subpoenaed to 
testify. On January 5, 1998, she met with her attorney, Frank Carter, and 
discussed questions that she might be asked at a deposition. One of the 
questions was how she had obtained her Pentagon job. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky worried 
that if the <U>Jones</U> lawyers checked with the White House about the 
transfer, some at the White House would say unflattering things about why she 
had been terminated.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_309_"><SUP>(309)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky spoke to President Clinton on the phone that evening and asked 
for advice on how to answer the question. Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky testified that the 
President responded, "<U>[Y]ou could always say</U> that the people in 
Legislative Affairs got it for you or helped you get it" -- a story that 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky stated was misleading because Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in fact had 
been transferred because she was around the Oval Office too much.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_310_"><SUP>(310)</SUP></A> 
President Clinton knew the truth. 
<P><A name=L86><STRONG>D. The President's Grand Jury Testimony on Cover 
Stories</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President testified that <U>before</U> he knew that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was 
a witness in the <U>Jones</U> case, he "might well" have told Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
that she could offer the cover stories if questioned about her presence in the 
West Wing and Oval Office: 
<P>Q: Did you ever say anything like that, you can always say that you were 
coming to see Betty or bringing me letters? Was that part of any kind of a, 
anything you said to her or a cover story, before you had any idea she was going 
to be part of Paula Jones? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: I might well have said that. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Okay. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: Because I certainly didn't want this to come out, if I could help it. 
And I was concerned about that. I was embarrassed about it. I knew it was 
wrong.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_311_"><SUP>(311)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>However, no doubt aware of the significance of the question, the President 
testified that he did not remember whether he had discussed the cover stories 
with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky during the December 17, 1997, conversation,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_312_"><SUP>(312)</SUP></A> 
or at any time <U>after</U> Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's name appeared on the 
<U>Jones</U> witness list: 
<P>Q: Did you tell [Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky] anytime in December something to that 
effect: You know, you can always say that you were coming to see Betty or you 
were bringing me letters? Did you say that, or anything like that, in December 
'97 or January '98, to Monica Lewinsky? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: Well, that's a very broad question. I do not recall saying anything like 
that <U>in connection with her testimony</U>. I could tell you what I do 
remember saying, if you want to know. But I don't -- we might have talked about 
what to do in a nonlegal context at some point in the past, but I have no 
specific memory of that conversation. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>I do remember what I said to her about the possible testimony. <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>* * * * <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Did you say anything like [the cover stories] once you knew or thought she 
might be a witness in the Jones case? Did you repeat the statement, or something 
like it to her? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: <U>Well, again, I don't recall, and I don't recall whether I might have 
done something like that, for example, if somebody says, what if the reporters 
ask me this, that or the other thing</U>. I can tell you this: In the context of 
whether she could be a witness, I have a recollection that she asked me, well, 
what do I do if I get called as a witness, and I said, you have to get a lawyer. 
And that's all I said. And I never asked her to lie. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Did you tell her to tell the truth? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: Well, I think the implication was she would tell the truth.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_313_"><SUP>(313)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L87><STRONG>E. Summary</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>There is substantial and credible information that the President and 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky reached an understanding that both of them would lie under 
oath when asked whether they had a sexual relationship (a conspiracy to obstruct 
justice or to commit perjury, in criminal law terms). Indeed, a tacit or express 
agreement to make false statements would have been an essential part of their 
December and January discussions, lest one of the two testify truthfully in the 
<U>Jones</U> case and thereby incriminate the other as a perjurer. 
<P>There also is substantial and credible information that President Clinton 
endeavored to obstruct justice by suggesting that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky file an 
affidavit to avoid her deposition, which would "lock in" her testimony under 
oath, and to attempt to avoid questions at his own deposition -- all to impede 
the gathering of discoverable evidence in the <U>Jones v. Clinton</U> 
litigation.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_314_"><SUP>(314)</SUP></A> 
<P>During the course of their relationship, the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
also discussed and used cover stories to justify her presence in and around the 
Oval Office area. The evidence indicates -- given Ms. Lewinsky's unambiguous 
testimony and the President's lack of memory, as well as the fact that they both 
planned to lie under oath -- that the President suggested the continued use of 
the cover stories even after Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was named as a potential witness 
in the <U>Jones</U> litigation. At no time did the President tell 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to abandon these stories and to tell the truth about her 
visits, nor did he ever indicate to her that she should tell the truth under 
oath about the relationship. While the President testified that he could not 
remember such conversations about the cover stories, he had repeated the 
substance of the cover stories in his <U>Jones</U> deposition. The President's 
use of false cover stories in testimony <U>under oath</U> in his <U>Jones</U> 
deposition strongly corroborates Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony that he suggested 
them to her on December 17 as a means of avoiding disclosure of the truth of 
their relationship. 
<P><A name=L88><STRONG>VII. There is substantial and credible information that 
President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by helping Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
obtain a job in New York at a time when she would have been a witness against 
him were she to tell the truth during the <U>Jones</U> case.</STRONG> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President had an incentive to keep Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky from jeopardizing 
the secrecy of the relationship. That incentive grew once the Supreme Court 
unanimously decided in May 1997 that the case and discovery process were to go 
forward. 
<P>At various times during the <U>Jones</U> discovery process, the President and 
those working on his behalf devoted substantial time and attention to help 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky obtain a job in the private sector. 
<P><A name=L89><STRONG>A. Evidence </STRONG>
<P>The entire saga of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's job search and the President's 
assistance in that search is discussed in detail in the Narrative section of 
this Referral. We summarize and analyze the key events and dates here. 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky first mentioned her desire to move to New York in a letter 
to the President on July 3, 1997. The letter recounted her frustration that she 
had not received an offer to return to work at the White House.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_315_"><SUP>(315)</SUP></A> 
<P>On October 1, the President was served with interrogatories asking about his 
sexual relationships with women other than Mrs. Clinton.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_316_"><SUP>(316)</SUP></A> 
On October 7, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky couriered a letter expressing 
dissatisfaction with her job search to the President.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_317_"><SUP>(317)</SUP></A> 
In response, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky said she received a late-night call from 
President Clinton on October 9, 1997. She said that the President told her he 
would start helping her find a job in New York.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_318_"><SUP>(318)</SUP></A> 
<P>The following Saturday, October 11, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met with 
President Clinton alone in the Oval Office dining room from 9:36 a.m. until 
about 10:54 a.m. In that meeting, she furnished the President a list of New York 
jobs in which she was interested.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_319_"><SUP>(319)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky mentioned to the President that she would need a reference 
from someone in the White House; the President said he would take care of it.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_320_"><SUP>(320)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky also suggested to the President that Vernon Jordan might be 
able to help her, and President Clinton agreed.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_321_"><SUP>(321)</SUP></A> 
Immediately after the meeting, President Clinton spoke with Mr.&nbsp;Jordan by 
telephone.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_322_"><SUP>(322)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, at some time in the 
summer or fall of 1997, President Clinton raised the subject of Monica Lewinsky 
and stated that "she was unhappy where she was working and wanted to come back 
and work at the OEOB [Old Executive Office Building]; and could we take a 
look."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_323_"><SUP>(323)</SUP></A> 
Mr.&nbsp;Bowles referred the matter to Deputy Chief of Staff John Podesta.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_324_"><SUP>(324)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Podesta said he asked Betty Currie to have Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky call 
him, but heard nothing until about October 1997, when Ms.&nbsp;Currie told him 
that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was looking for opportunities in New York.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_325_"><SUP>(325)</SUP></A> 
The Ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, said that 
Mr.&nbsp;Podesta told him that Ms.&nbsp;Currie had a friend looking for a 
position in New York.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_326_"><SUP>(326)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, Ambassador Richardson called her on October 
21, 1997,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_327_"><SUP>(327)</SUP></A> 
and interviewed her soon thereafter. She was then offered a position at the 
UN.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_328_"><SUP>(328)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was unenthusiastic.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_329_"><SUP>(329)</SUP></A> 
During the latter part of October 1997, the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
discussed enlisting Vernon Jordan to aid in pursuing private-sector 
possibilities.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_330_"><SUP>(330)</SUP></A> 
<P>On November 5, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met Mr.&nbsp;Jordan in his law office. 
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan told Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that she came "highly recommended."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_331_"><SUP>(331)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky explained that she hoped to move to New York, and went over 
her list of possible employers.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_332_"><SUP>(332)</SUP></A> 
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan telephoned President Clinton shortly after the meeting.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_333_"><SUP>(333)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had no contact with the President or Mr.&nbsp;Jordan for 
another month.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_334_"><SUP>(334)</SUP></A> 
On December 5, 1997, however, the parties in the <U>Jones</U> case exchanged 
witness lists. Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys listed Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky as a 
potential witness. The President testified that he learned that 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was on the list late in the day on December 6.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_335_"><SUP>(335)</SUP></A> 
<P>The effort to obtain a job for Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky then intensified. On 
December 7, President Clinton met with Mr.&nbsp;Jordan at the White House.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_336_"><SUP>(336)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky met with Mr.&nbsp;Jordan on December 11 to discuss specific 
job contacts in New York. Mr.&nbsp;Jordan gave her the names of some of his 
business contacts.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_337_"><SUP>(337)</SUP></A> 
He then made calls to contacts at MacAndrews &amp; Forbes (the parent 
corporation of Revlon), American Express, and Young &amp; Rubicam.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_338_"><SUP>(338)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Jordan also telephoned President Clinton to keep him informed of the 
efforts to help Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. Mr.&nbsp;Jordan testified that President 
Clinton was aware that people were trying to get jobs for her, that Mr. Podesta 
was trying to help her, that Bill Richardson was trying to help her, but that 
she wanted to work in the private sector.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_339_"><SUP>(339)</SUP></A> 
<P>On the same day of Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's meeting with Mr.&nbsp;Jordan, December 
11, Judge Wright ordered President Clinton, over his objection, to answer 
certain written interrogatories as part of the discovery process in 
<U>Jones</U>. Those interrogatories required, among other things, the President 
to identify any government employees since 1986 with whom he had engaged in 
sexual relations (a term undefined for purposes of the interrogatory).<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_340_"><SUP>(340)</SUP></A> 
On December 16, the President's attorneys received a request for production of 
documents that mentioned Monica Lewinsky by name. 
<P>On December 17, 1997, according to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, President Clinton 
called her in the early morning and told her that she was on the witness list, 
and they discussed their cover stories.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_341_"><SUP>(341)</SUP></A> 
On December 18 and December 23, she interviewed for jobs with New York-based 
companies that had been contacted by Mr.&nbsp;Jordan.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_342_"><SUP>(342)</SUP></A> 
On December 19, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was served with a deposition subpoena by 
Ms.&nbsp;Jones's lawyers.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_343_"><SUP>(343)</SUP></A> 
On December 22, 1997, Mr.&nbsp;Jordan took her to her new attorney; she and 
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan discussed the subpoena, the <U>Jones</U> case, and her job 
search during the course of the ride.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_344_"><SUP>(344)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President answered the "other women" interrogatory on December 23, 1997, 
by declaring under oath: "None."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_345_"><SUP>(345)</SUP></A> 
<P>On Sunday, December 28, 1997, Monica Lewinsky and the President met in the 
Oval Office.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_346_"><SUP>(346)</SUP></A> 
During that meeting, the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky discussed both her move 
to New York and her involvement in the <U>Jones</U> suit.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_347_"><SUP>(347)</SUP></A> 
<P>On January 5, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky declined the United Nations offer.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_348_"><SUP>(348)</SUP></A> 
On January 7, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky signed the affidavit denying the 
relationship with President Clinton (she had talked on the phone to the 
President on January 5 about it).<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_349_"><SUP>(349)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Jordan informed the President of her action.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_350_"><SUP>(350)</SUP></A> 
<P>The next day, on January 8, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky interviewed in New York 
with MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, a company recommended by Vernon Jordan. The 
interview went poorly. Mr.&nbsp;Jordan then called Ronald Perelman, the Chairman 
of the Board at MacAndrews &amp; Forbes. Mr.&nbsp;Perelman said 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky should not worry, and that someone would call her back for 
another interview. Mr.&nbsp;Jordan relayed this message to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, 
and someone called back that day.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_351_"><SUP>(351)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky interviewed again the next morning, and a few hours later 
received an informal offer for a position.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_352_"><SUP>(352)</SUP></A> 
She told Mr.&nbsp;Jordan of the offer, and Mr.&nbsp;Jordan then notified 
President Clinton with the news: "<U>Mission accomplished</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_353_"><SUP>(353)</SUP></A> 
<P>On January 12, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys informed Judge Wright that 
they might call Monica Lewinsky as a trial witness.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_354_"><SUP>(354)</SUP></A> 
Judge Wright stated that she would allow witnesses with whom the President had 
worked, such as Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, to be trial witnesses.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_355_"><SUP>(355)</SUP></A> 
<P>In a call on January 13, 1998, a Revlon employee formalized the job offer, 
and asked Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to provide references.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_356_"><SUP>(356)</SUP></A> 
Either that day or the next, President Clinton told Erskine Bowles that 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky "had found a job in the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. private sector, and 
she had listed John Hilley as a reference, and could we see if he could 
recommend her, if asked."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_357_"><SUP>(357)</SUP></A> 
Thereafter, Mr.&nbsp;Bowles took the President's request to Deputy Chief of 
Staff John Podesta, who in turn spoke to Mr.&nbsp;Hilley about writing a letter 
of recommendation. After speaking with Mr.&nbsp;Podesta, Mr.&nbsp;Hilley agreed 
to write such a letter, but cautioned it would be a "generic" one.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_358_"><SUP>(358)</SUP></A> 
On January 14, at approximately 11:17 a.m., Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky faxed her letter 
of acceptance to Revlon and listed Mr.&nbsp;Hilley as a reference.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_359_"><SUP>(359)</SUP></A> 
<P>On January 15, the President responded to the December 15 request for 
production of documents relating to Monica Lewinsky by answering "none." On 
January 16, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's attorney sent to the District Court in the 
<U>Jones</U> case her affidavit denying a "sexual relationship" with the 
President.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_360_"><SUP>(360)</SUP></A> 
The next day, on January 17, the President was deposed and his attorney used her 
affidavit as the President similarly denied a "sexual relationship." 
<P><A name=L90><STRONG>B. Summary</STRONG> 
<P><EM><A name=L91><STRONG></EM></STRONG>When a party in a lawsuit (or 
investigation) provides job or financial assistance to a witness, a question 
arises as to possible witness tampering. The critical question centers on the 
intent of the party providing the assistance. Direct evidence of that intent 
often is unavailable. Indeed, in some cases, the witness receiving the job 
assistance may not even know that the party providing the assistance was 
motivated by a desire to stay on good terms with the witness during the pending 
legal proceeding.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_361_"><SUP>(361)</SUP></A> 
Similarly, others who are enlisted in the party's effort to influence the 
witness's testimony by providing job assistance may not be aware of the party's 
motivation and intent. 
<P>One can draw inferences about the party's intent from circumstantial 
evidence. In this case, the President assisted Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in her job 
search in late 1997, at a time when she would have become a witness harmful to 
him in the <U>Jones</U> case <U>were she to testify truthfully</U>. The 
President did not act half-heartedly. His assistance led to the involvement of 
the Ambassador to the United Nations, one of the country's leading business 
figures (Mr.&nbsp;Perelman), and one of the country's leading attorneys (Vernon 
Jordan). 
<P>The question, therefore, is whether the President's efforts in obtaining a 
job for Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky were to influence her testimony<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_362_"><SUP>(362)</SUP></A> 
or simply to help an ex-intimate without concern for her testimony. Three key 
facts are essential in analyzing his actions: (i) the chronology of events, (ii) 
the fact that the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky <U>both</U> intended to lie 
under oath about the relationship, and (iii) the fact that it was critical for 
the President that Ms. Lewinsky lie under oath. 
<P>There is substantial and credible information that the President assisted Ms. 
Lewinsky in her job search motivated at least in part by his desire to keep her 
"on the team" in the <U>Jones</U> litigation. 
<P><A name=L92><STRONG><EM></STRONG></EM>
<P><A name=L93><STRONG>VIII. There is substantial and credible information that 
the President lied under oath in describing his conversations with Vernon Jordan 
about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky</STRONG>. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>President Clinton was asked during his civil deposition whether he had talked 
to Mr.&nbsp;Jordan about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's involvement in the <U>Jones</U> 
case. The President stated that he knew Mr.&nbsp;Jordan had talked to Ms. 
Lewinsky about her move to New York, but stated that he did not recall whether 
Mr. Jordan had talked to Ms. Lewinsky about her involvement in the <U>Jones</U> 
case. The testimony was false. A lie under oath about these conversations was 
necessary to avoid inquiry into whether Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's job and her 
testimony were improperly related. 
<P><A name=L94><STRONG>A. President's Testimony in the <U>Jones</U> 
Case</STRONG> 
<P>The President was questioned in his civil deposition about his conversations 
with Vernon Jordan regarding Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and her role in the 
<U>Jones</U>&nbsp;case. Beforehand, the President was asked a general question: 
<P>Q: Did anyone other than your attorneys ever tell you that Monica Lewinsky 
had been served with a subpoena in this case? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: <U>I don't think so</U>.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_363_"><SUP>(363)</SUP></A> 
<P>
<P>The President later testified in more detail about conversations he may have 
had with Mr.&nbsp;Jordan concerning Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's role in the case: 
<P>Q: Excluding conversations that you may have had with Mr.&nbsp;Bennett or any 
of your attorneys in this case, within the past two weeks has anyone reported to 
you that they had had a conversation with Monica Lewinsky concerning this 
lawsuit? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: I don't believe so. I'm sorry, I just don't believe so. <BR wp="br1"><BR 
wp="br2">
<P>* * * * <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q. Has it ever been reported to you that [Vernon Jordan] met with Monica 
Lewinsky and talked about this case? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: I knew that he met with her. I think Betty suggested that he meet with 
her. Anyway, he met with her. <U>I, I thought that he talked to her about 
something else. I didn't know that</U> -- I thought he had given her some advice 
about her move to New York. <U>Seems like that's what Betty said</U>.<A

<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L95><STRONG>B. Evidence That Contradicts the President's Civil 
Deposition Testimony</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Vernon Jordan testified that his conversations with the President about 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's subpoena were, in fact, "a continuing dialogue."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_365_"><SUP>(365)</SUP></A> 
When asked if he had kept the President informed about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's 
status in the <U>Jones</U> case in addition to her job search, Mr.&nbsp;Jordan 
responded: "The two -- absolutely."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_366_"><SUP>(366)</SUP></A> 
<P>On December 19, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky phoned Mr.&nbsp;Jordan and told him that 
she had been subpoenaed in the <U>Jones</U> case.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_367_"><SUP>(367)</SUP></A> 
Following that call, Mr.&nbsp;Jordan telephoned the President to inform him 
"that Monica Lewinsky was coming to see me, and that she had a subpoena"<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_368_"><SUP>(368)</SUP></A> 
-- but the President was unavailable.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_369_"><SUP>(369)</SUP></A> 
Later that day, at 5:01 p.m., Mr.&nbsp;Jordan had a seven-minute telephone 
conversation with the President:<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_370_"><SUP>(370)</SUP></A> 
<P>I said to the President, "Monica Lewinsky called me up. She's upset. She's 
gotten a subpoena. She is coming to see me about this subpoena. I'm confident 
that she needs a lawyer, and I will try to get her a lawyer."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_371_"><SUP>(371)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Later on December 19, after meeting with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, Mr.&nbsp;Jordan 
went to the White House and met with the President alone in the Residence.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_372_"><SUP>(372)</SUP></A> 
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan testified: "I told him that Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed, 
came to me with a subpoena."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_373_"><SUP>(373)</SUP></A> 
According to Mr.&nbsp;Jordan, the President "thanked me for my efforts to get 
her a job and thanked me for getting her a lawyer."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_374_"><SUP>(374)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Mr.&nbsp;Jordan, on January 7, 1998, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky showed 
him a copy of her signed affidavit denying any sexual relationship with the 
President.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_375_"><SUP>(375)</SUP></A> 
He testified that he told the President about the affidavit, probably in one of 
his two logged calls to the White House that day:<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_376_"><SUP>(376)</SUP></A> 
<P>Q: [W]alk us through what exactly you would have said on the portion of the 
conversation that related to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and the affidavit. <BR

<P>VJ: Monica Lewinsky signed the affidavit. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>* * * * <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: [L]et's say if it was January 7th, or whenever it was that you informed 
him that she signed the affidavit,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_377_"><SUP>(377)</SUP></A> 
is it accurate that based on the conversations you had with him already, you 
didn't have to explain to him what the affidavit was? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>VJ: I think that's a reasonable assumption. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: So that it would have made sense that you would have just said, "She 
signed the affidavit," because both you and he knew what the affidavit was? <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>VJ: I think that's a reasonable assumption. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: All right. When you indicated to the President that she had signed the 
affidavit, what, if anything, did he tell you? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>VJ: I think he -- his judgment was consistent with mine that that was -- the 
signing of the affidavit was consistent with the truth.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_378_"><SUP>(378)</SUP></A> 
<P>
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Jordan testified that "I knew that the President was concerned about 
the affidavit and whether or not it was signed. <U>He was, obviously</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_379_"><SUP>(379)</SUP></A> 
When asked why he believed the President was concerned, Mr.&nbsp;Jordan 
testified: 
<P>Here is a friend of his who is being called as a witness in another case and 
with whom I had gotten a lawyer, I told him about that, and told him I was 
looking for a job for her. He knew about all of that. <U>And it was just a 
matter of course that he would be concerned as to whether or not she had signed 
an affidavit foreswearing what I told you the other day, that there was no 
sexual relationship</U>.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_380_"><SUP>(380)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Jordan summarized his contacts with the President about Monica 
Lewinsky and her involvement in the <U>Jones</U> litigation as follows: 
<P>I made arrangements for a lawyer and I told the President that. When she 
signed the affidavit, I told the President that the affidavit had been signed 
and when Frank Carter told me that he had filed a motion to quash, as I did in 
the course of everything else, I said to the President that I saw Frank Carter 
and he had informed me that he was filing a motion to quash. It was as a simple 
information flow, absent a substantive discussion about her defense, about which 
I was not involved.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_381_"><SUP>(381)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President himself testified in the grand jury that he talked to 
Mr.&nbsp;Jordan about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's involvement in the case. Despite his 
earlier statements at the deposition, the President testified to the grand jury 
that he had no reason to doubt that he had talked to Mr.&nbsp;Jordan about 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's subpoena, her lawyer, and her affidavit.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_382_"><SUP>(382)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L96><STRONG>C. Summary</STRONG> 
<P>In his civil deposition, the President stated that he had talked to Vernon 
Jordan about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's job. But as the testimony of Mr.&nbsp;Jordan 
reveals, and as the President as much as conceded in his subsequent grand jury 
appearance,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_383_"><SUP>(383)</SUP></A> 
the President <U>did</U> talk to Mr.&nbsp;Jordan about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's 
involvement in the <U>Jones</U> case -- including that she had been subpoenaed, 
that Mr.&nbsp;Jordan had helped her obtain a lawyer, and that she had signed an 
affidavit denying a sexual relationship with the President. Given their several 
communications in the weeks before the deposition, it is not credible that the 
President forgot the subject of their conversations during his civil deposition. 
His statements "seems like that's what Betty said" and "I didn't know that" were 
more than mere omissions; they were affirmative misstatements. 
<P>The President's motive for making false and misleading statements about this 
subject in his civil deposition was straightforward. If the President admitted 
that he had talked with Vernon Jordan both about Monica Lewinsky's involvement 
in the <U>Jones</U> case <U>and</U> about her job, questions would inevitably 
arise about whether Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's testimony and her future job were 
connected. Such an admission by the President in his civil deposition likely 
would have prompted Ms.&nbsp;Jones's attorneys to inquire further into the 
subject. And such an admission in his deposition would have triggered public 
scrutiny when the deposition became public. 
<P>At the time of his deposition, moreover, the President was aware of the 
potential problems in admitting any possible link between those two subjects. A 
criminal investigation and substantial public attention had focused in 1997 on 
job assistance and payments made to Webster Hubbell in 1994. The jobs and money 
paid to Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell by friends and contributors to the President had raised 
serious questions about whether such assistance was designed to influence 
Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell's testimony about Madison-related matters.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_384_"><SUP>(384)</SUP></A> 
Some of Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell's jobs, moreover, had been arranged by Vernon Jordan, 
which was likely a further deterrent to the President raising both 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's job and her affidavit in connection with Vernon 
Jordan.<EM></EM> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2"><BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L97><STRONG>IX. There is substantial and credible information that 
President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by attempting to influence the 
testimony of Betty Currie.</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>In a meeting with Betty Currie on the day after his deposition and in a 
separate conversation a few days later, President Clinton made statements to her 
that he knew were false. The contents of the statements and the context in which 
they were made indicate that President Clinton was attempting to influence the 
testimony that Ms.&nbsp;Currie might have been required to give in the 
<U>Jones</U> case or in a grand jury investigation.<A

<P><A name=L99><STRONG>1. Saturday, January 17, 1998, Deposition</STRONG> 
<P>President Clinton's deposition in <U>Jones v. Clinton</U>&nbsp;occurred on 
Saturday, January 17, 1998. In that deposition, the President testified that he 
could not recall being alone with Monica Lewinsky and that he had not had sexual 
relations, a sexual affair, or a sexual relationship with her. During his 
testimony, the President referred several times to Betty Currie and to her 
relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. He stated, for example, that the last time 
he had seen Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was when she had come to the White House to see 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie;<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_386_"><SUP>(386)</SUP></A> 
that Ms.&nbsp;Currie was present when the President had made a joking reference 
about the <U>Jones</U> case to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky;<A

that Ms.&nbsp;Currie was his source of information about Vernon Jordan's 
assistance to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky;<A

and that Ms.&nbsp;Currie had helped set up the meetings between 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky and Mr.&nbsp;Jordan regarding her move to New York.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_389_"><SUP>(389)</SUP></A> 
<P>At the deposition, Judge Wright imposed a protective order that prevented the 
parties from discussing their testimony with anyone else. "Before he leaves, I 
want to remind him, as the witness in this matter, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that this 
case is subject to a Protective Order regarding all discovery, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
[A]ll parties present, including .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the witness are not to say

<P><A name=L100><STRONG>2. Sunday, January 18, 1998, Meeting with 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie</STRONG> 
<P>Because the President referred so often to Ms.&nbsp;Currie, it was 
foreseeable that she might become a witness in the <U>Jones</U> matter, 
particularly if specific allegations of the President's relationship with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky came to light.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_391_"><SUP>(391)</SUP></A> 
Indeed, according to Ms.&nbsp;Currie, President Clinton at some point may have 
told her that she might be asked about Monica Lewinsky.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_392_"><SUP>(392)</SUP></A> 
<P>Shortly after 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, January 17, 1998, two and a half hours 
after he returned from the deposition, President Clinton called Ms.&nbsp;Currie 
at home<A

and asked her to come to the White House the next day.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_394_"><SUP>(394)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie testified that "[i]t's rare for [President Clinton] to ask me to 
come in on Sunday."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_395_"><SUP>(395)</SUP></A> 
<P>At about 5:00 p.m. on Sunday, January 18, Ms.&nbsp;Currie went to meet with 
President Clinton at the White House. She told the grand jury: 
<P>He said that he had had his deposition yesterday, and they had asked several 
questions about Monica Lewinsky. And I was a little shocked by that or -- 
(shrugging). And he said -- I don't know if he said -- I think he may have said, 
"There are several things you may want to know," or "There are things -- " He 
asked me some questions.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_396_"><SUP>(396)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>According to Ms.&nbsp;Currie, the President then said to her in succession:<A

<P>"You were always there when she was there, right? We were never really 
alone."<A

<P>"She wanted to have sex with me, and I can't do that."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_401_"><SUP>(401)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Currie indicated that these remarks were "more like statements than 
questions."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_402_"><SUP>(402)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie concluded that the President wanted her to agree with him.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_403_"><SUP>(403)</SUP></A> 
She based that conclusion on the way he made most of the statements and on his 
demeanor.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_404_"><SUP>(404)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie also said that she felt the President made these remarks to see 
her reaction.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_405_"><SUP>(405)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms.&nbsp;Currie said that she indicated her agreement with each of the 
President's statements,<A

although she knew that the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had in fact been 
alone in the Oval Office and in the President's study.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_407_"><SUP>(407)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie also knew that she could not or did not in fact hear or see the 
President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky while they were alone.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_408_"><SUP>(408)</SUP></A> 
<P>In the context of this conversation, President Clinton appeared to be 
"concerned," according to Ms. Currie.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_409_"><SUP>(409)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President's concern over the questions asked at the civil deposition 
about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky also manifested itself in substantial efforts to contact 
Monica Lewinsky over the next two days. Shortly after her meeting with the 
President, Ms.&nbsp;Currie made several attempts to contact Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie testified it was "possible" she did so at the President's 
suggestion, and said "he may have asked me to call [Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky] to see 
what she knew or where she was or what was happening."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_410_"><SUP>(410)</SUP></A> 
Later that same night, at 11:01 p.m., the President again called Ms.&nbsp;Currie 
at home.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_411_"><SUP>(411)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie could not recall the substance but suggested that the President 
had called to ask whether she had spoken to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_412_"><SUP>(412)</SUP></A> 
The next day, January 19, 1998, which was a holiday, Ms.&nbsp;Currie made seven 
unsuccessful attempts to contact Monica Lewinsky, by pager, between 7:00 a.m. 
and 9:00 a.m.<A

The President called Ms.&nbsp;Currie at home twice, and Ms.&nbsp;Currie called 
the President at the White House once that day.<A

<P><A name=L101><STRONG>3. Conversation Between the President and 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie on Tuesday, January 20, 1998, or Wednesday, January 21, 
1998</STRONG>. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>On either Tuesday, January 20 or Wednesday, January 21 of that week, the 
President again met with Ms.&nbsp;Currie and discussed the Monica Lewinsky 
matter. Ms.&nbsp;Currie testified as follows: 
<P>BC: It was Tuesday or Wednesday. I don't remember which one this was, either. 
But the best I remember, when he called me in the Oval Office, <U>it was sort of 
a recap[it]ulation of what we had talked about on Sunday -- you know, "I was 
never alone with her" -- that sort of thing.</U> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Did he pretty much list the same -- <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>BC: To my recollection, sir, yes. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: <U>And did he say it in sort of the same tone and demeanor that he used 
the first time he told you on Sunday?</U> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>BC: <U>The best I remember, sir, yes.</U> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>* * * * <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: And the President called you into the Oval Office specifically to list 
these things? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>BC: I don't know if that's specifically what he called me in for, but once I 
got inside, that's what he -- <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: That's what he told you? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>BC: Uh-huh.<A

<P><A name=L102><STRONG>B. The President's Grand Jury Testimony</STRONG> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President was asked why he might have said to Ms.&nbsp;Currie in their 
meeting on Sunday, January 18, 1998, "we were never alone together, right?" and 
"you could see and hear everything." The President testified: 
<P>[W]hat I was trying to determine was <U>whether my recollection was right</U> 
and that she was always in the office complex when Monica was there, and whether 
she thought she could hear any conversations we had, or did she hear any. <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>* * * * <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>I was trying to -- I knew .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to a reasonable certainty that I 
was going to be asked more questions about this. I didn't really expect you to 
be in the Jones case at the time. I thought what would happen is that it would 
break in the press, and <U>I was trying to get the facts down. I was trying to 
understand what the facts were.</U><A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_416_"><SUP>(416)</SUP></A> 
<P>
<P>Later, the President stated that he was referring to a larger area than 
simply the room where he and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky were located. He also testified 
that his statements to Ms.&nbsp;Currie were intended to cover a limited range of 
dates: 
<P>WJC: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [W]hen I said, we were never alone, right, I 
think I also asked her a number of other questions, because there were several 
times, as I'm sure she would acknowledge, when I either asked her to be around. 
I remember once in particular when I was talking with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky when I 
asked Betty to be in the, actually, in the next room in the dining room, and, as 
I testified earlier, once in her own office. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>But I meant that she was always in the Oval Office complex, in that complex, 
while Monica was there. <U>And I believe that this was part of a series of 
questions I asked her to try to quickly refresh my memory. So, I wasn't trying 
to get her to say something that wasn't so.</U> And, in fact, I think she would 
recall that I told her to just relax, go in the grand jury and tell the truth 
when she had been called as a witness. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: So, when you said to Mrs. Currie that, I was never alone with her, right, 
you just meant that you and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky would be somewhere perhaps in the 
Oval Office or many times in your back study, is that correct? <BR wp="br1"><BR 
wp="br2">
<P>WJC: That's right. We were in the back study. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: And then -- <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: Keep in mind, sir, I just want to make it -- I was talking about 1997. I 
was never, ever trying to get Betty Currie to claim that on the occasions when 
Monica Lewinsky was there when she wasn't anywhere around, that she was. I would 
never have done that to her, and I don't think she thought about that. I don't 
think she thought I was referring to that. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Did you put a date restriction? Did you make it clear to Mrs. Currie that 
you were only asking her whether you were never alone with her after 1997? <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: Well, I don't recall whether I did or not, but I assumed -- if I didn't, 
<U>I assumed she knew what I was talking about</U>, because it was the point at 
which Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was out of the White House and had to have someone WAVE 
her in, in order to get in the White House. And I do not believe to this day 
that I was -- in 1997, that she was ever there and that I ever saw her unless 
Betty Currie was there. I don't believe she was.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_417_"><SUP>(417)</SUP></A> 
<P>With respect to the word "alone," the President also stated that "it depends 
on how you define alone" and "there were a lot of times when we were alone, but 
I never really thought we were."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_418_"><SUP>(418)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President was also asked about his specific statement to Betty Currie 
that "you could see and hear everything." He testified that he was uncertain 
what he intended by that comment: 
<P>Q: When you said to Mrs. Currie, you could see and hear everything, that 
wasn't true either, was it, as far as you knew. You've already -- 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My memory of that was that, that she had the ability to 
hear what was going on if she came in the Oval Office from her office. And a lot 
of times, you know, when I was in the Oval Office, she just had the door open to 
her office. Then there was -- the door was never completely closed to the hall. 
<U>So I think there was -- I'm not entirely sure what I meant by that, but I 
could have meant that she generally would be able to hear conversations, even if 
she couldn't see them</U>. And I think that's what I meant.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_419_"><SUP>(419)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President then testified that when he made the comment to Ms.&nbsp;Currie 
about her being able to hear everything, he again was referring to only a 
limited period of time: 
<P>Q: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.you would not have engaged in those physically 
intimate acts if you knew that Mrs. Currie could see or hear that, is that 
correct? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: That's correct. But keep in mind, sir, I was talking about 1997. That 
occurred, to the -- and I believe that occurred only once in February of 1997. I 
stopped it. I never should have started it, and I certainly shouldn't have 
started it back after I resolved not to in 1996. And I was referring to 1997. 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>And I -- what -- as I say, I do not know -- her memory and mine may be 
somewhat different. I do not know whether I was asking her about a particular 
time when Monica was upset and I asked her to stand, stay back in the dining 
area. Or whether I was, had reference to the fact that if she kept the door open 
to the Oval Office, because it was always -- the door to the hallway was always 
somewhat open, that she would always be able to hear something if anything went 
on that was, you know, too loud, or whatever. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><U>I do not know what I meant</U>. I'm just trying to reconcile the two 
statements as best I can, without being sure.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_420_"><SUP>(420)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President was also asked about his comment to Ms.&nbsp;Currie that 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had "come on" to him, but that he had "never touched her": 
<P>Q: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [I]f [Ms.&nbsp;Currie] testified that you told her, 
Monica came on to me and I never touched her, you did, in fact, of course, touch 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, isn't that right, in a physically intimate way? <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: Now, I've testified about that. And that's one of those questions that I 
believe is answered by the statement that I made.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_421_"><SUP>(421)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: What was your purpose in making these statements to Mrs. Currie, if it 
weren't for the purpose to try to suggest to her what she should say if ever 
asked? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: Now, Mr.&nbsp;Bittman, I told you, the only thing I remember is when all 
this stuff blew up, <U>I was trying to figure out what the facts were. I was 
trying to remember. I was trying to remember every time I had seen 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.</U> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2"><BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I knew this was all going to come out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I 
did not know [at the time] that the Office of Independent Counsel was involved. 
<U>And I was trying to get the facts and try to think of the best defense we 
could construct in the face of what I thought was going to be a media 
onslaught</U>.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_422_"><SUP>(422)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Finally, the President was asked why he would have called Ms.&nbsp;Currie 
into his office a few days after the Sunday meeting and repeated the statements 
about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to her. The President testified that although he would 
not dispute Ms.&nbsp;Currie's testimony to the contrary, he did not remember 
having a second conversation with her along these lines.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_423_"><SUP>(423)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L103><STRONG>C. Summary</STRONG> 
<P>The President referred to Ms.&nbsp;Currie on multiple occasions in his civil 
deposition when describing his relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. As he 
himself recognized, a large number of questions about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky were 
likely to be asked in the very near future. The President thus could foresee 
that Ms.&nbsp;Currie either might be deposed or questioned or might need to 
prepare an affidavit. 
<P>The President called her shortly after the deposition and met with 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie the next day. The President appeared "concerned," according to 
Ms.&nbsp;Currie. He then informed Ms.&nbsp;Currie that questions about 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had been asked at the deposition. 
<P>The statements the President made to her on January 18 and again on January 
20 or 21 -- that he was never alone with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, that Ms.&nbsp;Currie 
could always hear or see them, and that he never touched Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky -- 
were false, but consistent with the testimony that the President provided under 
oath at his deposition. The President knew that the statements were false at the 
time he made them to Ms.&nbsp;Currie. The President's suggestion that he was 
simply trying to refresh his memory when talking to Ms.&nbsp;Currie conflicts 
with common sense: Ms.&nbsp;Currie's confirmation of <U>false</U> statements 
could not in any way remind the President of the facts. Thus, it is not 
plausible that he was trying to refresh his recollection. 
<P>The President's grand jury testimony reinforces that conclusion. He testified 
that in asking questions of Ms. Currie such as "We were never alone, right" and 
"Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right," he intended a date 
restriction on the questions. But he did not articulate a date restriction in 
his conversations with Ms. Currie. Moreover, with respect to some aspects of 
this incident, the President was unable to devise any innocent explanation, 
testifying that he did not know why he had asked Ms. Currie some questions and 
admitting that he was "just trying to reconcile the two statements as best [he 
could]." On the other hand, if the most reasonable inference from the 
President's conduct is drawn -- that he was attempting to enlist a witness to 
back up his false testimony from the day before -- his behavior with Ms. Currie 
makes complete sense. 
<P>The content of the President's statements and the context in which those 
statements were made provide substantial and credible information that President 
Clinton sought improperly to influence Ms.&nbsp;Currie's testimony. Such actions 
constitute an obstruction of justice and improper influence on a witness. <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L104><STRONG>X. There is substantial and credible information that 
President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice during the federal grand jury 
investigation. While refusing to testify for seven months, he simultaneously 
lied to potential grand jury witnesses knowing that they would relay the 
falsehoods to the grand jury. </STRONG>
<P>
<P>The President's grand jury testimony followed seven months of investigation 
in which he had refused six invitations to testify before the grand jury. During 
this period, there was no indication that the President would admit any sexual 
relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. To the contrary, the President vehemently 
denied the allegations. 
<P>Rather than lie to the grand jury himself, the President lied about his 
relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to senior aides, and those aides then 
conveyed the President's false story to the grand jury.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_424_"><SUP>(424)</SUP></A> 
<P>In this case, the President lied to, among others, three current senior aides 
-- John Podesta, Erskine Bowles, and Sidney Blumenthal -- and one former senior 
aide, Harold Ickes. The President denied any kind of sexual relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky; said that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had made a sexual demand on him; 
and denied multiple telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky. The President, 
by his own later admission, was aware that his aides were likely to convey the 
President's version of events to the grand jury. 
<P>The President's aides took the President at his word when he made these 
statements. Each aide then testified to the nature of the relationship between 
Monica Lewinsky and the President based on those statements -- without knowing 
that they were calculated falsehoods by the President designed to perpetuate the 
false statements that the President made during his deposition in the 
<U>Jones</U> case. 
<P>The aides' testimony provided the grand jury a false account of the 
relationship between the President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. Their testimony thus 
had the potential to affect the investigation -- including decisions by the OIC 
and grand jury about how to conduct the investigation (for example, whether to 
subpoena Secret Service agents) and whether to indict particular individuals. 
<P><A name=L105><STRONG>A. </STRONG>T<STRONG>he Testimony of Current and Former 
Aides</STRONG> 
<P><A name=L106><STRONG>1. John Podesta</STRONG> 
<P>John Podesta, Deputy Chief of Staff,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_425_"><SUP>(425)</SUP></A> 
testified that on several occasions shortly after the media first began 
reporting the Lewinsky allegations, the President either denied having a 
relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky or otherwise minimized his involvement with 
her. 
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Podesta described a meeting with the President, Chief of Staff 
Erskine Bowles, and Deputy Chief of Staff Sylvia Matthews, in the morning of 
January 21, 1998.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_426_"><SUP>(426)</SUP></A> 
During that meeting, the President stated: "Erskine, I want you to know that 
this story is not true."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_427_"><SUP>(427)</SUP></A> 
Mr.&nbsp;Podesta further recalled that the President said "that he had not had a 
sexual relationship with her, and that he never asked anybody to lie."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_428_"><SUP>(428)</SUP></A> 
<P>Several days later, on January 23, 1998, the President more adamantly told 
Mr.&nbsp;Podesta that he had not engaged in sex of any "kind, shape or manner" 
with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. Mr.&nbsp;Podesta recalled: <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>JP: [H]e said to me that he had never had sex with her, and that -- and that 
he never asked -- you know, he repeated the denial, <U>but he was extremely 
explicit in saying he never had sex with her</U>. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: How do you mean? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>JP: Just what I said. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Okay. Not explicit, in the sense that he got more specific than sex, than 
the word "sex." <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>JP: Yes, he was more specific than that. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Okay. Share that with us. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>JP: Well, I think he said -- <U>he said that -- there was some spate of, you 
know, what sex acts were counted, and he said that he had never had sex with her 
in any way whatsoever -- </U><BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Okay. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>JP: <U>--that they had not had oral sex</U>.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_429_"><SUP>(429)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Later, possibly that same day,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_430_"><SUP>(430)</SUP></A> 
the President made a further statement to Mr.&nbsp;Podesta regarding his 
relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. Mr.&nbsp;Podesta testified that the 
President "said to me that after [Monica] left [her job at the White House], 
that when she had come by, she came by to see Betty, and that he -- when she was 
there, either Betty was with them -- either that she was with Betty when he saw 
her or that he saw her in the Oval Office with the door open and Betty was 
around -- and Betty was out at her desk."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_431_"><SUP>(431)</SUP></A> 
The President relayed to Mr. Podesta one of the false "cover stories" that the 
President and Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had agreed to use. 
<P>Both the President and Mr.&nbsp;Podesta knew that Mr.&nbsp;Podesta was likely 
to be a witness in the ongoing grand jury criminal investigation.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_432_"><SUP>(432)</SUP></A> 
Nonetheless, Mr.&nbsp;Podesta recalled that the President "volunteered" to 
provide information about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to him<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_433_"><SUP>(433)</SUP></A> 
<U>even though Mr.&nbsp;Podesta had not asked for these details</U>.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_434_"><SUP>(434)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Podesta "believe[d]" the President, and testified that it was 
important to him that the President denied the affair.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_435_"><SUP>(435)</SUP></A> 
Mr.&nbsp;Podesta repeated to the grand jury the false and misleading statements 
that the President told him. 
<P><A name=L107><STRONG>2. Erskine Bowles</STRONG> 
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Bowles, the White House Chief of Staff,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_436_"><SUP>(436)</SUP></A> 
confirmed Mr.&nbsp;Podesta's account of the President's January 21, 1998, 
statement in which the President denied having a sexual relationship with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. Mr.&nbsp;Bowles testified: 
<P>EB: And this was the day this huge story breaks. And the three of us walked 
in together -- Sylvia Matthews, John Podesta, and me -- into the Oval Office, 
and the President was standing behind his desk. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: About what time of day is this? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>EB: This is approximately 9:00 in the morning, or something -- you know, in 
that area. And he looked up at us and he said the same thing he said to the 
American people. He said, "<U>I want you to know I did not have sexual 
relationships [sic] with this woman Monica Lewinsky</U>. I did not ask anybody 
to lie. And when the facts come out, you'll understand."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_437_"><SUP>(437)</SUP></A> 
<P>
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Bowles testified that he took the President's statements seriously: 
"All I can tell you is: This guy who I've worked for looked me in the eye and 
said he did not have sexual relationships with her. And if I didn't believe him, 
I couldn't stay. So I believe him."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_438_"><SUP>(438)</SUP></A> 
Mr.&nbsp;Bowles repeated the President's false and misleading statement to the 
grand jury. 
<P><A name=L108><STRONG>3. Sidney Blumenthal</STRONG> 
<P>Sidney Blumenthal, an Assistant to the President,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_439_"><SUP>(439)</SUP></A> 
similarly testified that the President made statements to him denying the 
Lewinsky allegations shortly after the first media report. 
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal stated that he spoke to Mrs. Clinton on the afternoon of 
January 21, 1998, and to the President early that evening. During those 
conversations, both the President and Mrs. Clinton offered an explanation for 
the President's meetings with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, and President Clinton offered 
an explanation for Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's allegations of a sexual relationship.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_440_"><SUP>(440)</SUP></A> 
<P>Testifying before the grand jury, Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal related his discussion 
with President Clinton: 
<P>I said to the President, "What have you done wrong?" And he said, "Nothing. I 
haven't done anything wrong." 
<P>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it was at that point that he gave his account of what had 
happened to me and he said that Monica -- and it came very fast. He said, 
"<U>Monica Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual demand on me." He rebuffed her. 
He said, "I've gone down that road before, I've caused pain for a lot of people 
and I'm not going to do that again</U>." 
<P>
<P><U>She threatened him. She said that she would tell people they'd had an 
affair, that she was known as the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it 
and if she had an affair or said she had an affair then she wouldn't be the 
stalker any more</U>.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_441_"><SUP>(441)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal testified that the President appeared "upset" during this 
conversation.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_442_"><SUP>(442)</SUP></A> 
<P>Finally, Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal asked the President to explain alleged answering 
machine messages (a detail mentioned in press reports). 
<P>He said that he remembered calling her when Betty Currie's brother died and 
that he left a message on her voice machine that Betty's brother had died and he 
said she was close to Betty and had been very kind to Betty. And that's what he 
recalled.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_443_"><SUP>(443)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>According to Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal, the President said that the call he made to 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky relating to Betty's brother was the "only one he could 
remember."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_444_"><SUP>(444)</SUP></A> 
That was false: The President and Ms. Lewinsky talked often on the phone, and 
the subject matter of the calls was memorable. 
<P>A grand juror asked Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal whether the President had said that 
his relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky included any kind of sexual activity. 
Mr. Blumenthal testified that the President's response was "the opposite. <U>He 
told me that she came on to him and that he had told her he couldn't have sexual 
relations with her and that she threatened him. That is what he told me</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_445_"><SUP>(445)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal testified that after the President relayed this 
information to him, he "certainly believed his story. It was a very heartfelt 
story, he was pouring out his heart, and I believed him."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_446_"><SUP>(446)</SUP></A> 
Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal repeated to the grand jury the false statements that the 
President made to him. 
<P><A name=L109><STRONG>4. Harold Ickes</STRONG> 
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Ickes, a former Deputy Chief of Staff,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_447_"><SUP>(447)</SUP></A> 
also related to the grand jury a conversation that he had with the President on 
the morning of January 26, 1998,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_448_"><SUP>(448)</SUP></A> 
during which the President denied the Lewinsky allegations. 
<P>Regarding that conversation, Mr.&nbsp;Ickes testified: "The two things that I 
recall, the two things that he again repeated in public -- had already said 
publicly and repeated in public that same Monday morning was that <U>he had not 
had -- he did not have a -- or he had not had a sexual relationship with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky</U> and that he had done nothing -- now I'm paraphrasing -- 
had done nothing to ask anybody to change their story or suborn perjury or 
obstruct justice."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_449_"><SUP>(449)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr.&nbsp;Ickes recalled that the President probably volunteered this 
information.<A

Mr.&nbsp;Ickes repeated the President's false statements to the grand jury. 
<P><A name=L110><STRONG>B. The President's Grand Jury Testimony</STRONG> 
<P>The President admitted to the grand jury that, after the allegations were 
publicly reported, he made "misleading" statements to particular aides whom he 
knew would likely be 
<P>called to testify before the grand jury. The President testified as follows: 
<P>Q: Do you recall denying any sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky to the 
following people: Harry Thomasson, Erskine Bowles, Harold Ickes, 
Mr.&nbsp;Podesta, Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal, Mr.&nbsp;Jordan, Ms.&nbsp;Betty Currie? 
Do you recall denying any sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky to those 
individuals? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: <U>I recall telling a number of those people that I didn't have, either 
I didn't have an affair with Monica Lewinsky or didn't have sex with her.</U> 
And I believe, sir, that -- you'll have to ask them what they thought. But I was 
using those terms in the normal way people use them. <U>You'll have to ask them 
what they thought I was saying</U>. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: If they testified that you denied sexual relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky, or if they told us that you denied that, do you have any reason to 
doubt them, in the days after the story broke; do you have any reason to doubt 
them? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: <U>No</U>. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President then was specifically asked whether he knew that his aides were 
likely to be called before the grand jury. 
<P>Q: It may have been misleading, sir, and you knew though, after January 21st 
when the Post article broke and said that Judge Starr was looking into this, you 
knew that they might be witnesses. <U>You knew that they might be called into a 
grand jury, didn't you</U>? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: <U>That's right</U>. I think I was quite careful what I said after that. 
I may have said something to all these people to that effect, but I'll also -- 
whenever anybody asked me any details, I said, look, I don't want you to be a 
witness or I turn you into a witness or give you information that would get you 
in trouble. I just wouldn't talk. I, by and large, didn't talk to people about 
this. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: If all of these people -- let's leave out Mrs. Currie for a minute. Vernon 
Jordan, Sid Blumenthal, John Podesta, Harold Ickes, Erskine Bowles, Harry 
Thomasson, after the story broke, after Judge Starr's involvement was known on 
January 21st, have said that you denied a sexual relationship with them. Are you 
denying that? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: <U>No</U>. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: And you've told us that you -- <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: I'm just telling you what I meant by it. I told you what I meant by it 
when they started this deposition. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: You've told us now that you were being careful, but that it might have 
been misleading. Is that correct? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: <U>It might have been</U>. . . . So, what I was trying to do was to give 
them something they could -- that would be true, <U>even if misleading in the 
context of this deposition</U>, and keep them out of trouble, and let's deal -- 
and deal with what I thought was the almost ludicrous suggestion that I had 
urged someone to lie or tried to suborn perjury, in other words.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_451_"><SUP>(451)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L111><STRONG>C. Summary </STRONG>
<P>The President made the following misleading statements to his aides: 
<P>The President told Mr.&nbsp;Podesta that he had not engaged in sex "in any 
way whatsoever" with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky, <U>"including oral sex"</U>. <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President told Mr.&nbsp;Podesta, Mr.&nbsp;Bowles, and Mr.&nbsp;Ickes that 
he did not have a "sexual relationship" with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. <BR wp="br1"><BR 
wp="br2">
<P>The President told Mr.&nbsp;Podesta that "when [Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky] came by, 
she came by to see Betty [Currie]." 
<P>The President told Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky "came on to him 
and that he had told her he couldn't have sexual relations with her and that she 
threatened him." <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President told Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal that he couldn't remember making any 
calls to Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky other than once when he left a message on her 
answering machine. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>During the President's grand jury testimony, the President admitted that his 
statements to aides denying a sexual relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky "may 
have been misleading."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_452_"><SUP>(452)</SUP></A> 
The President also knew his aides likely would be called to testify regarding 
any communications with him about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. And he presumably expected 
his aides to repeat his statements regarding Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky to all 
questioners, including to the grand jury. Finally, he himself refused to testify 
for many months. The combination of the President's silence and his deception of 
his aides had the effect of presenting a false view of events to the grand jury. 

<P>The President says that at the time he spoke to his aides, he chose his words 
with great care so that, in his view, his statements would be literally true 
because he was referring only to intercourse. That explanation is undermined by 
the President's testimony before the grand jury that his denials "may have been 
misleading" and by the contradictory testimony by the aides themselves -- 
particularly John Podesta, who says that the President specifically denied oral 
sex with Ms. Lewinsky. Moreover, on January 24, 1998, the White House issued 
talking points for its staff, and those talking points refute the President's 
literal truth argument: The talking points state as the President's view the 
belief that a relationship that includes oral sex is "of course" a "sexual 
relationship."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_453_"><SUP>(453)</SUP></A> 
<P>For all of these reasons, there is substantial and credible information that 
the President improperly tampered with witnesses during the grand jury 
investigation. 
<P><A name=L112><STRONG>XI. There is substantial and credible information that 
President Clinton's actions since January 17, 1998, regarding his relationship 
with Monica Lewinsky have been inconsistent with the President's constitutional 
duty to faithfully execute the laws.</STRONG> 
<P>
<P>Before, during, and after his January 17, 1998, civil deposition, the 
President attempted to conceal the truth about his relationship with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky from the judicial process in the <U>Jones</U> case. 
Furthermore, the President has since lied under oath to the grand jury and 
facilitated the provision of false information to the grand jury by others. 
<P>The President also misled the American people and the Congress in his public 
statement of January 26, 1998, in which he denied "sexual relations" with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. The President misled his Cabinet and his senior aides by 
denying the relationship to them. The Cabinet and senior aides in turn misled 
the American people and the Congress by conveying the President's denials and 
professing their belief in the credibility of those denials. 
<P>The President promised in January 1998 to cooperate fully with the grand jury 
investigation and to provide "more rather than less, sooner rather than later." 
At that time, the OIC was conducting a criminal investigation and was obligated 
to report to Congress any substantial and credible information that may 
constitute grounds for an impeachment. 
<P>The President's conduct delayed the grand jury investigation (and thereby 
delayed any potential congressional proceedings). He asserted, appealed, 
withdrew, and reasserted Executive Privilege (and asserted other governmental 
privileges never before applied in federal criminal proceedings <U>against</U> 
the government). The President asserted these privileges concerning the 
investigation of factual questions about which the President already knew the 
answers. The President refused six invitations to testify voluntarily before the 
grand jury. At the same time, the President's aides and surrogates argued 
publicly that the entire matter was frivolous and that any investigation of it 
should cease. 
<P>After being subpoenaed in July, the President made false statements to the 
grand jury on August 17, 1998. That night, the President again made false 
statements to the American people and Congress, contending that his answers in 
his civil deposition had been "legally accurate." The President then made an 
implicit plea for Congress to take no action: "Our country has been distracted 
by this matter for too long."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_454_"><SUP>(454)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President has pursued a strategy of (i)&nbsp;deceiving the American 
people and Congress in January 1998, (ii)&nbsp;delaying and impeding the 
criminal investigation for seven months, and (iii)&nbsp;deceiving the American 
people and Congress again in August 1998. 
<P><A name=L113><STRONG>A. Beginning on January 21, 1998, the President misled 
the American people and Congress regarding the truth of his relationship with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.</STRONG> 
<P>On January 21, 1998, the day the <U>Washington Post</U> first reported the 
Lewinsky matter, the President talked to his long-time advisor Dick Morris. With 
the President's approval, Mr.&nbsp;Morris commissioned a poll that evening. The 
results indicated that voters were willing to forgive the President for adultery 
but <U>not</U> for perjury or obstruction of justice.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_455_"><SUP>(455)</SUP></A> 
When the President telephoned him that evening, Mr.&nbsp;Morris explained that 
the President thus should not go public with a confession or explanation.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_456_"><SUP>(456)</SUP></A> 
According to Mr.&nbsp;Morris, the President replied, "<U>Well, we just have to 
win, then</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_457_"><SUP>(457)</SUP></A> 
<P>The next evening, the President dissuaded Mr.&nbsp;Morris from any plan to 
"blast[] Monica Lewinsky 'out of the water.'" The President indicated that 
"there's some slight chance that she may not be cooperating with Starr and we 
don't want to alienate her."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_458_"><SUP>(458)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President himself spoke publicly about the matter several times in the 
initial days after the story broke. On January 26, the President was definitive: 
"I want to say one thing to the American people. I want you to listen to me. I'm 
going to say this again: I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss 
Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time. Never. These 
allegations are false."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_459_"><SUP>(459)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President's emphatic denial to the American people was false. And his 
statement was not an impromptu comment in the heat of a press conference. To the 
contrary, it was an intentional and calculated falsehood to deceive the Congress 
and the American people.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_460_"><SUP>(460)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L114><STRONG>B. The First Lady, the Cabinet, the President's staff, 
and the President's associates relied on and publicly emphasized the President's 
denial.</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>After the President lied to the American people, the President's associates 
argued that the allegations against the President were false and even 
scurrilous. 
<P>Mrs. Clinton forcefully denied the allegations on January 27, 1998, one day 
after the President's public denial. She admitted that the American people 
"should certainly be concerned" if a President had an affair and lied to cover 
it up. She acknowledged that it would be a "very serious offense." But she 
emphasized that the allegations were false -- a "pretty bad" smear. She noted 
that the President "has denied these allegations on all counts, unequivocally." 
And Mrs. Clinton shifted the focus away from the President, indicated that "this 
is a battle" and stated that "some folks are going to have a lot to answer for" 
when the facts come out.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_461_"><SUP>(461)</SUP></A> 
<P>The most senior officials in the Executive Branch served as additional 
(albeit unwitting) agents of the President's deception. The Cabinet and White 
House aides stated emphatically that the allegations were false. For example, 
White House spokesperson Michael McCurry was asked whether the President's 
denial covered all forms of sexual contact, and Mr. McCurry stated that "I think 
every American that heard him knows exactly what he meant."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_462_"><SUP>(462)</SUP></A> 
So, too, White House Communications Director Ann Lewis said on January 26, 1998: 
"I can say with absolute assurance the President of the United States did not 
have a sexual relationship because I have heard the President of the United 
States say so. He has said it, he could not be more clear. He could not have 
been more direct."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_463_"><SUP>(463)</SUP></A> 
She added: "Sex is sex, even in Washington. I've been assured."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_464_"><SUP>(464)</SUP></A> 
<P>After a Cabinet meeting on January 23, 1998, in which the President offered 
denials, several members of the Cabinet appeared outside the White House. 
Secretary of State Albright stated: "I believe that the allegations are 
completely untrue."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_465_"><SUP>(465)</SUP></A> 
Coupled with the President's firm denial, the united front of the President's 
closest advisors helped shape perception of the issue. 
<P><A name=L115><STRONG>C. The President repeatedly and unlawfully invoked the 
Executive Privilege to conceal evidence of his personal misconduct from the 
grand jury.</STRONG> 
<P>
<P>When the allegations about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky first arose, the President 
informed the American people that he would cooperate fully. He told Jim Lehrer 
that "we are doing our best to cooperate here."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_466_"><SUP>(466)</SUP></A> 
He told National Public Radio that "I have told people that I would cooperate in 
the investigation, and I expect to cooperate with it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'm 
going to do my best to cooperate with the investigation."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_467_"><SUP>(467)</SUP></A> 
He told <U>Roll Call</U> "I'm going to cooperate with this 
investigation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And I'll cooperate."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_468_"><SUP>(468)</SUP></A> 
<P>Such cooperation did not occur. The White House's approach to the 
constitutionally based principle of Executive Privilege most clearly exposed the 
non-cooperation. In 1994, White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler issued an opinion 
that the Clinton Administration would not invoke Executive Privilege for cases 
involving personal wrongdoing by any government official.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_469_"><SUP>(469)</SUP></A> 
By 1998, however, the President had blended the official and personal dimensions 
to the degree that the President's private counsel stated in a legal brief filed 
in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit: "In a very 
real and significant way, the objectives of William J. Clinton, the person, and 
his Administration (the Clinton White House) are one and the same."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_470_"><SUP>(470)</SUP></A> 
<P>After the Monica Lewinsky investigation began, the President invoked 
Executive Privilege for the testimony of five witnesses: Bruce Lindsey, Cheryl 
Mills, Nancy Hernreich, Sidney Blumenthal, and Lanny Breuer. These claims were 
patently groundless. Even for <U>official</U> communications within the scope of 
the privilege, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1974 in <U>United States 
v. Nixon</U><A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_471_"><SUP>(471)</SUP></A>&nbsp;that 
the Executive Privilege gives way in the face of the compelling need for 
evidence in criminal proceedings. 
<P>The President's assertion of Executive Privilege for Ms.&nbsp;Hernreich, an 
assistant who manages the secretarial work for the Oval Office,<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_472_"><SUP>(472)</SUP></A> 
was frivolous. At the time that the President was asserting Executive Privilege 
for one assistant, the President's other assistant (Betty Currie) had already 
testified extensively. 
<P>Based on <U>Nixon</U>, the OIC filed a motion to compel the testimony of 
Hernreich, Lindsey, and Blumenthal. The United States District Court held a 
hearing on March 20. Just before the hearing, the White House -- without 
explanation -- dropped its Executive Privilege claim as to Ms.&nbsp;Hernreich.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_473_"><SUP>(473)</SUP></A> 
<P>On May 4, 1998, Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled against the 
President on the Executive Privilege issue.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_474_"><SUP>(474)</SUP></A> 
After the White House filed a notice of appeal, the OIC filed an expedited 
petition for certiorari before judgment in the Supreme Court. The President 
thereupon dropped his claim of Executive Privilege. 
<P>The tactics employed by the White House have not been confined to the 
judicial process. On March 24, while the President was traveling in Africa, he 
was asked about the assertion of Executive Privilege. He responded, "You should 
ask someone who knows." He also stated "I haven't discussed that with the 
lawyers. I don't know."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_475_"><SUP>(475)</SUP></A> 
<P>This was untrue. Unbeknownst to the public, in a declaration filed in 
District Court on March 17 (seven days before the President's public expression 
of ignorance), White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff informed Chief Judge 
Johnson that he "ha[d] discussed" the matter with the President, who had 
directed the assertion of Executive Privilege.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_476_"><SUP>(476)</SUP></A> 
<P>The deception has continued. Because the President withdrew his Executive 
Privilege claim while the case was pending in the Supreme Court of the United 
States, it was assumed that the President would no longer assert Executive 
Privilege. But that assumption proved incorrect. White House attorney Lanny 
Breuer appeared before the grand jury on August 4, 1998, and invoked Executive 
Privilege. He would not answer, for example, whether the President had told him 
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and whether they had discussed the 
gifts he had given to Monica Lewinsky.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_477_"><SUP>(477)</SUP></A> 
On August 11, 1998, Chief Judge Johnson denied the Executive Privilege claim as 
a basis for refusing to testify, and ordered Mr.&nbsp;Breuer to testify.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_478_"><SUP>(478)</SUP></A> 
<P>On August 11, 1998, Deputy White House Counsel Cheryl Mills testified and 
repeatedly asserted Executive Privilege at the President's direction.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_479_"><SUP>(479)</SUP></A> 
The breadth of the claim was striking: The privilege was asserted not only for 
Ms.&nbsp;Mills's communications with the President, senior staff, and staff 
members of the White House Counsel's Office -- but also for Ms.&nbsp;Mills's 
communications with <U>private</U> lawyers for the President, <U>private</U> 
lawyers for grand jury witnesses, and Betty Currie.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_480_"><SUP>(480)</SUP></A> 
<P>On August 17, the President testified before the grand jury. At the request 
of a grand juror, the OIC asked the President about his assertions of Executive 
Privilege and why he had withdrawn the claim before the Supreme Court. The 
President replied that "I didn't really want to advance an executive privilege 
claim in this case beyond having it litigated, so that we, we had not given up 
on principal [sic] this matter, without having some judge rule on 
it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <U>I strongly felt we should not appeal your victory on 
the executive privilege issue</U>."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_481_"><SUP>(481)</SUP></A> 
<P>Four days after this sworn statement, on August 21, 1998, the President filed 
a notice of appeal with respect to the Executive Privilege claim for Lanny 
Breuer that Chief Judge Johnson had denied ten days earlier (and six days before 
the President's testimony). In addition, Bruce Lindsey appeared again before the 
grand jury on August 28, 1998, and the President <U>again</U> asserted Executive 
Privilege with respect to his testimony -- even though the President had dropped 
the claim of Executive Privilege for Mr.&nbsp;Lindsey while the case was pending 
before the Supreme Court of the United States in June.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_482_"><SUP>(482)</SUP></A> 
<P>The Executive Privilege was not the only claim of privilege interposed to 
prevent the grand jury from gathering relevant information. The President also 
acquiesced in the Secret Service's attempt to have the Judiciary craft a new 
protective function privilege (rejecting requests by this Office that the 
President order the Secret Service officers to testify). The District Court and 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the 
privilege claim. The litigation was disruptive to the Secret Service and to the 
grand jury. The frivolity of the claim is evidenced by the Chief Justice's 
decision to reject the Secret Service's request for a stay without even 
referring the matter to the full Court. All of that litigation would have been 
unnecessary had the President testified in February instead of August, or had he 
taken the position that relevant facts should be fully available to the grand 
jury. 
<P><A name=L116><STRONG>D. The President refused six invitations to testify to 
the grand jury, thereby delaying expeditious resolution of this matter, and then 
refused to answer relevant questions before the grand jury when he testified in 
August 1998. </STRONG><BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>This Office extended six separate invitations to the President to testify 
before the grand jury. The first invitation was issued on January 28, 1998. The 
OIC repeated the invitations on behalf of the grand jury on February 4, February 
9, February 21, March 2, and March 13. The President declined each invitation. 
His refusals substantially delayed this Office's investigation. 
<P>Finally, in the face of the President's actions, this Office asked the grand 
jury to consider issuing a subpoena to the President. The grand jury deliberated 
and approved the issuance of a subpoena. On July 17, 1998, the OIC served the 
subpoena, in accordance with the grand jury's action, on the President's private 
counsel. The subpoena required the President to appear on July 28. 
<P>The President sought to delay his testimony.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_483_"><SUP>(483)</SUP></A> 
Shortly after a hearing before the District Court on the President's motion for 
a continuance, the President and the OIC reached an agreement by which the 
President would testify on August 17 via live video feed to the grand jury. In a 
Rose Garden ceremony on July 31, 1998, the President stated to the country: "I'm 
looking forward to the opportunity . . . of testifying. I will do so completely 
and truthfully."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_484_"><SUP>(484)</SUP></A> 
<P>At the outset of his grand jury appearance, the President similarly stated: 
"I will answer each question as accurately and fully as I can."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_485_"><SUP>(485)</SUP></A> 
The President then read a prepared statement in which he admitted "inappropriate 
intimate contact" with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_486_"><SUP>(486)</SUP></A> 
Despite his statement that he would answer each question, the President refused 
to answer specific questions about that contact (other than to indicate that it 
was not intercourse and did not involve the direct touching of 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's breasts or genitals).<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_487_"><SUP>(487)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L117><STRONG>E. The President misled the American people and the 
Congress in his public statement on August 17, 1998, when he stated that his 
answers at his civil deposition in January had been "legally accurate."</STRONG> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President addressed the Nation on the evening of August 17, 1998, after 
his grand jury appearance. The President did not tell the truth. He stated: "As 
you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions about my 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers were <U>legally 
accurate</U>, I did not volunteer information."<A 
href="7grounds.htm#N_488_"><SUP>(488)</SUP></A> 
As this Referral has demonstrated, the President's statements in his civil 
deposition were <U>not</U> "legally accurate," and he could not reasonably have 
thought they were. They were deliberate falsehoods designed to conceal the truth 
of the President's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
<P>The President's claim that his testimony during the civil deposition was 
legally accurate -- which he made to the grand jury and to the American people 
on August 17 -- perpetuates the deception and concealment that has accompanied 
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky since his first sexual encounter with her 
on November 15, 1995. 
<P><A name=L118><STRONG>F. Summary</STRONG> 
<P>In this case, the President made and caused to be made false statements to 
the American people about his relationship with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky. He also made 
false statements about whether he had lied under oath or otherwise obstructed 
justice in his civil case. By publicly and emphatically stating in January 1998 
that "I did not have sexual relations with that woman" and these "allegations 
are false," the President also effectively delayed a possible congressional 
inquiry, and then he further delayed it by asserting Executive Privilege and 
refusing to testify for six months during the Independent Counsel investigation. 
This represents substantial and credible information that may constitute grounds 
for an impeachment.

President said that the word "cause" implies "forcing to me" and "forcible 
abusive behavior." Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 17. And thus the President said that he 
did not lie under oath in denying that he "caused" contact with the genitalia of 
any person because his activity with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky did not include any 
nonconsensual behavior. <U>Id.</U> at 18.

person, with intent to -- (1)&nbsp;influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of 
any person in an official proceeding . . . shall be fined under this title or 
imprisoned not more than ten years, or both." 18 U.S.C.  1512(b). It is no 
defense to a charge of witness tampering that the official proceeding had not 
yet begun, nor is it a defense that the testimony sought to be influenced turned 
out to be inadmissible or subject to a claim of privilege. 18 U.S.C.  1512(e).

<P><A name=N_460_>460. </A>Other than Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's status and age, 
several aspects of the relationship could have raised public concerns. <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><U>First</U>, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky lost her job at the White House in April 1996 
and was transferred to the Pentagon. Under oath, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was asked: 
"Do you believe that if you hadn't had a sexual relationship with the President 
that you would have kept your job at the White House?" She answered: "Yes." 
Lewinsky 8/26/98 Depo. at 60. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><U>Second</U>, Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky was asked, "Do you believe that your 
difficulty or inability to return to employment at the White House was because 
of your sexual relationship with him?" She answered: "Yes. Or the issues that, 
or that the problems that people perceived that really were based in truth 
because I had a relationship with the President." Lewinsky 8/26/98 Depo. at 60. 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><U>Third</U>, in late 1997, the President saw to it that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky 
received extraordinary job assistance. Such assistance might have been tied to 
her involvement in the <U>Jones</U> case, as discussed earlier, as well as a 
benefit to an ex-paramour. If the latter was a factor, then the President's 
actions discriminated against all of those interns and employees who did not 
receive the same benefit.

<P><A name=N_482_>482. </A>Lindsey 8/28/98 GJ at 58. The President's use and 
withdrawal of Executive Privilege was not new to this Office. In August 1996, 
the White House invoked Executive Privilege to prevent White House attorneys 
from producing documents regarding their communications with Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. After the OIC filed a motion to compel in the United States District 
Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, the claim was withdrawn, and the 
White House relied solely on a claim of government attorney-client privilege, 
which the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected. The 
public never knew at that time of the President's assertion of Executive 
Privilege in that case. 
<P>
<P>In 1997, the President again asserted Executive Privilege -- this time to 
prevent Thomas "Mack" McLarty from testifying fully. The conversations in 
question related in part to Mr.&nbsp;McLarty's efforts to find employment for 
Webster Hubbell as Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell was resigning his position as Associate 
Attorney General. The President withdrew the assertion before the OIC filed a 
motion to compel.
