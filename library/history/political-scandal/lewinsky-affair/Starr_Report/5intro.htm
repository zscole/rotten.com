wp="br2">
<P>As required by Section 595(c) of Title 28 of the United States Code, the 
Office of the Independent Counsel ("OIC" or "Office") hereby submits substantial 
and credible information that President William Jefferson Clinton committed acts 
that may constitute grounds for an impeachment.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> 
<P>The information reveals that President Clinton: 
<P>lied under oath at a civil deposition while he was a defendant in a sexual 
harassment lawsuit; <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>lied under oath to a grand jury; <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>attempted to influence the testimony of a potential witness who had direct 
knowledge of facts that would reveal the falsity of his deposition testimony; 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>attempted to obstruct justice by facilitating a witness's plan to refuse to 
comply with a subpoena; <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>attempted to obstruct justice by encouraging a witness to file an affidavit 
that the President knew would be false, and then by making use of that false 
affidavit at his own deposition; <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>lied to potential grand jury witnesses, knowing that they would repeat those 
lies before the grand jury; and <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>engaged in a pattern of conduct that was inconsistent with his constitutional 
duty to faithfully execute the laws. 
<P>The evidence shows that these acts, and others, were part of a pattern that 
began as an effort to prevent the disclosure of information about the 
President's relationship with a former White House intern and employee, Monica 
S. Lewinsky, and continued as an effort to prevent the information from being 
disclosed in an ongoing criminal investigation. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>
<CENTER><A name=L2><STRONG>Factual Background</STRONG></CENTER><BR wp="br1"><BR 
wp="br2">
<P>In May 1994, Paula Corbin Jones filed a lawsuit against William Jefferson 
Clinton in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Arkansas.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> Ms. 
Jones alleged that while he was the Governor of Arkansas, President Clinton 
sexually harassed her during an incident in a Little Rock hotel room.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> 
President Clinton denied the allegations. He also challenged the ability of a 
private litigant to pursue a lawsuit against a sitting President. In May 1997, 
the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the President's legal argument. The Court 
concluded that Ms. Jones, "[l]ike every other citizen who properly invokes [the 
District Court's] jurisdiction . . . has a right to an orderly disposition of 
her claims," and that therefore Ms. Jones was entitled to pursue her claims 
while the President was in office.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> A few 
months later, the pretrial discovery process began.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> 
<P>One sharply disputed issue in the <U>Jones</U> litigation was the extent to 
which the President would be required to disclose information about sexual 
relationships he may have had with "other women." Ms. Jones's attorneys sought 
disclosure of this information, arguing that it was relevant to proving that the 
President had propositioned Ms. Jones. The President resisted the discovery 
requests, arguing that evidence of relationships with other women (if any) was 
irrelevant. 
<P>In late 1997, the issue was presented to United States District Judge Susan 
Webber Wright for resolution. Judge Wright's decision was unambiguous. For 
purposes of pretrial discovery, President Clinton was required to provide 
certain information about his alleged relationships with other women. In an 
order dated December 11, 1997, for example, Judge Wright said: "The Court finds, 
therefore, that the plaintiff is entitled to information regarding any 
individuals with whom the President had sexual relations or proposed or sought 
to have sexual relations and who were during the relevant time frame state or 
federal employees."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> Judge 
Wright left for another day the issue whether any information of this type would 
be admissible were the case to go to trial. But for purposes of answering the 
written questions served on the President, and for purposes of answering 
questions at a deposition, the District Court ruled that the President must 
respond. 
<P>In mid-December 1997, the President answered one of the written discovery 
questions posed by Ms. Jones on this issue. When asked to identify all women who 
were state or federal employees and with whom he had had "sexual relations" 
since 1986,<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> the 
President answered under oath: "None."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A> For 
purposes of this interrogatory, the term "sexual relations" was not defined. 
<P>On January 17, 1998, President Clinton was questioned under oath about his 
relationships with other women in the workplace, this time at a deposition. 
Judge Wright presided over the deposition. The President was asked numerous 
questions about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, by then a 24-year-old 
former White House intern, White House employee, and Pentagon employee. Under 
oath and in the presence of Judge Wright, the President denied that he had 
engaged in a "sexual affair," a "sexual relationship," or "sexual relations" 
with Ms. Lewinsky. The President also stated that he had no specific memory of 
having been alone with Ms. Lewinsky, that he remembered few details of any gifts 
they might have exchanged, and indicated that no one except his attorneys had 
kept him informed of Ms. Lewinsky's status as a potential witness in the 
<U>Jones</U> case. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>
<CENTER><A name=L3><STRONG>The Investigation</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>On January 12, 1998, this Office received information that Monica Lewinsky 
was attempting to influence the testimony of one of the witnesses in the 
<U>Jones</U> litigation, and that Ms. Lewinsky herself was prepared to provide 
false information under oath in that lawsuit. The OIC was also informed that Ms. 
Lewinsky had spoken to the President and the President's close friend Vernon 
Jordan about being subpoenaed to testify in the <U>Jones</U> suit, and that 
Vernon Jordan and others were helping her find a job. The allegations with 
respect to Mr. Jordan and the job search were similar to ones already under 
review in the ongoing Whitewater investigation.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> 
<P>After gathering preliminary evidence to test the information's reliability, 
the OIC presented the evidence to Attorney General Janet Reno. Based on her 
review of the information, the Attorney General determined that a further 
investigation by the Independent Counsel was required. 
<P>On the following day, Attorney General Reno petitioned the Special Division 
of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, on 
an expedited basis, to expand the jurisdiction of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. 
Starr. On January 16, 1998, in response to the Attorney General's request, the 
Special Division issued an order that provides in pertinent part: 
<P>The Independent Counsel shall have jurisdiction and authority to investigate 
to the maximum extent authorized by the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act 
of 1994 whether Monica Lewinsky or others suborned perjury, obstructed justice, 
intimidated witnesses, or otherwise violated federal law other than a Class B or 
C misdemeanor or infraction in dealing with witnesses, potential witnesses, 
attorneys, or others concerning the civil case <U>Jones v. Clinton</U>.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>On January 28, 1998, after the allegations about the President's relationship 
with Ms. Lewinsky became public, the OIC filed a Motion for Limited Intervention 
and a Stay of Discovery in <U>Jones v. Clinton</U>. The OIC argued that the 
civil discovery process should be halted because it was having a negative effect 
on the criminal investigation. The OIC represented to the Court that numerous 
individuals then under subpoena in <U>Jones</U>, including Monica Lewinsky, were 
integral to the OIC's investigation, and that courts routinely stayed discovery 
in such circumstances.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A> 
<P>The next day Judge Wright responded to the OIC's motion. The Court ruled that 
discovery would be permitted to continue, except to the extent that it sought 
information about Monica Lewinsky. The Court acknowledged that "evidence 
concerning Monica Lewinsky might be relevant to the issues in [the <U>Jones</U>] 
case."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A> It 
concluded, however, that this evidence was not "essential to the core issues in 
this case," and that some of that evidence "might even be inadmissible."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A> The 
Court found that the potential value of this evidence was outweighed by the 
potential delay to the <U>Jones</U> case in continuing to seek discovery about 
Ms. Lewinsky.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_14_"><SUP>(14)</SUP></A> The 
Court also was concerned that the OIC's investigation "could be impaired and 
prejudiced were the Court to permit inquiry into the Lewinsky matter by the 
parties in this civil case."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_15_"><SUP>(15)</SUP></A> 
<P>On March 9, 1998, Judge Wright denied Ms. Jones's motion for reconsideration 
of the decision regarding Monica Lewinsky. The order states: 
<P>The Court readily acknowledges that evidence of the Lewinsky matter might 
have been relevant to plaintiff's case and, as she argues, that such evidence 
might possibly have helped her establish, among other things, intent, absence of 
mistake, motive, and habit on the part of the President. . .&nbsp;. 
Nevertheless, whatever relevance such evidence may otherwise have . . . it 
simply is not essential to the core issues in this case . . . .<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>On April 1, 1998, Judge Wright granted President Clinton's motion for summary 
judgment, concluding that even if the facts alleged by Paula Jones were true, 
her claims failed as a matter of law.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_17_"><SUP>(17)</SUP></A> Ms. 
Jones has filed an appeal, and as of the date of this Referral, the matter 
remains under consideration by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth 
Circuit. 
<P>After the dismissal of Ms. Jones's lawsuit, the criminal investigation 
continued. It was (and is) the view of this Office that any attempt to obstruct 
the proper functioning of the judicial system, regardless of the perceived 
merits of the underlying case, is a serious matter that warrants further 
inquiry. After careful consideration of all the evidence, the OIC has concluded 
that the evidence of wrongdoing is substantial and credible, and that the 
wrongdoing is of sufficient gravity that it warrants referral to Congress.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_18_"><SUP>(18)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>
<CENTER><A name=L4><STRONG>The Significance of the Evidence of 
Wrongdoing</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>It is not the role of this Office to determine whether the President's 
actions warrant impeachment by the House and removal by the Senate; those 
judgments are, of course, constitutionally entrusted to the legislative 
branch.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_19_"><SUP>(19)</SUP></A> This 
Office is authorized, rather, to conduct criminal investigations and to seek 
criminal prosecutions for matters within its jurisdiction.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_20_"><SUP>(20)</SUP></A> In 
carrying out its investigation, however, this Office also has a statutory duty 
to disclose to Congress information that "may constitute grounds for an 
impeachment," a task that inevitably requires judgment about the seriousness of 
the acts revealed by the evidence. 
<P>From the beginning, this phase of the OIC's investigation has been criticized 
as an improper inquiry into the President's personal behavior; indeed, the 
President himself suggested that specific inquiries into his conduct were part 
of an effort to "criminalize my private life."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_21_"><SUP>(21)</SUP></A> The 
regrettable fact that the investigation has often required witnesses to discuss 
sensitive personal matters has fueled this perception. 
<P>All Americans, including the President, are entitled to enjoy a private 
family life, free from public or governmental scrutiny. But the privacy concerns 
raised in this case are subject to limits, three of which we briefly set forth 
here. 
<P><U>First</U>. The first limit was imposed when the President was sued in 
federal court for alleged sexual harassment. The evidence in such litigation is 
often personal. At times, that evidence is highly embarrassing for both 
plaintiff and defendant. As Judge Wright noted at the President's January 1998 
deposition, "I have never had a sexual harassment case where there was not some 
embarrassment."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_22_"><SUP>(22)</SUP></A> 
Nevertheless, Congress and the Supreme Court have concluded that 
embarrassment-related concerns must give way to the greater interest in allowing 
aggrieved parties to pursue their claims. Courts have long recognized the 
difficulties of proving sexual harassment in the workplace, inasmuch as improper 
or unlawful behavior often takes place in private.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_23_"><SUP>(23)</SUP></A> To 
excuse a party who lied or concealed evidence on the ground that the evidence 
covered only "personal" or "private" behavior would frustrate the goals that 
Congress and the courts have sought to achieve in enacting and interpreting the 
Nation's sexual harassment laws. That is particularly true when the conduct that 
is being concealed -- sexual relations in the workplace between a high official 
and a young subordinate employee -- itself conflicts with those goals. 
<P><U>Second</U>. The second limit was imposed when Judge Wright required 
disclosure of the precise information that is in part the subject of this 
Referral. A federal judge specifically ordered the President, on more than one 
occasion, to provide the requested information about relationships with other 
women, including Monica Lewinsky. The fact that Judge Wright later determined 
that the evidence would not be admissible at trial, and still later granted 
judgment in the President's favor, does not change the President's legal duty at 
the time he testified. Like every litigant, the President was entitled to object 
to the discovery questions, and to seek guidance from the court if he thought 
those questions were improper. But having failed to convince the court that his 
objections were well founded, the President was duty bound to testify truthfully 
and fully. Perjury and attempts to obstruct the gathering of evidence can never 
be an acceptable response to a court order, regardless of the eventual course or 
outcome of the litigation. 
<P>The Supreme Court has spoken forcefully about perjury and other forms of 
obstruction of justice: 
<P>In this constitutional process of securing a witness' testimony, perjury 
simply has no place whatever. Perjured testimony is an obvious and flagrant 
affront to the basic concepts of judicial proceedings. Effective restraints 
against this type of egregious offense are therefore imperative.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_24_"><SUP>(24)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The insidious effects of perjury occur whether the case is civil or criminal. 
Only a few years ago, the Supreme Court considered a false statement made in a 
civil administrative proceeding: "False testimony in a formal proceeding is 
intolerable. We must neither reward nor condone such a 'flagrant affront' to the 
truth-seeking function of adversary proceedings. . . . Perjury should be 
severely sanctioned in appropriate cases."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_25_"><SUP>(25)</SUP></A> 
Stated more simply, "[p]erjury is an obstruction of justice."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_26_"><SUP>(26)</SUP></A> 
<P><U>Third</U>. The third limit is unique to the President. "The Presidency is 
more than an executive responsibility. It is the inspiring symbol of all that is 
highest in American purpose and ideals."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_27_"><SUP>(27)</SUP></A> When 
he took the Oath of Office in 1993 and again in 1997, President Clinton swore 
that he would "faithfully execute the Office of President."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_28_"><SUP>(28)</SUP></A> As 
the head of the Executive Branch, the President has the constitutional duty to 
"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_29_"><SUP>(29)</SUP></A> The 
President gave his testimony in the <U>Jones</U> case under oath and in the 
presence of a federal judge, a member of a co-equal branch of government; he 
then testified before a federal grand jury, a body of citizens who had 
themselves taken an oath to seek the truth. In view of the enormous trust and 
responsibility attendant to his high Office, the President has a manifest duty 
to ensure that his conduct at all times complies with the law of the land. <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>In sum, perjury and acts that obstruct justice by any citizen -- whether in a 
criminal case, a grand jury investigation, a congressional hearing, a civil 
trial, or civil discovery -- are profoundly serious matters. When such acts are 
committed by the President of the United States, we believe those acts "may 
constitute grounds for an impeachment." 
<P>
<CENTER><A name=L5><STRONG>The Scope of the Referral</STRONG></CENTER>
<P><A name=L6><STRONG>1. Background of the Investigation. </STRONG>The link 
between the OIC's jurisdiction -- as it existed at the end of 1997 -- and the 
matters set forth in this Referral is complex but direct. In January 1998, Linda 
Tripp, a witness in three ongoing OIC investigations, came forward with 
allegations that: (i) Monica Lewinsky was planning to commit perjury in <U>Jones 
v. Clinton</U>, and (ii) she had asked Ms. Tripp to do the same. Ms. Tripp also 
stated that: (i) Vernon Jordan had counseled Ms. Lewinsky and helped her obtain 
legal representation in the <U>Jones</U> case, and (ii) at the same time, Mr. 
Jordan was helping Ms. Lewinsky obtain employment in the private sector. 
<P>OIC investigators and prosecutors recognized parallels between Mr. Jordan's 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and his earlier relationship with a pivotal 
Whitewater-Madison figure, Webster L. Hubbell. Prior to January 1998, the OIC 
possessed evidence that Vernon Jordan -- along with other high-level associates 
of the President and First Lady -- helped Mr. Hubbell obtain lucrative 
consulting contracts while he was a potential witness and/or subject in the 
OIC's ongoing investigation. This assistance took place, moreover, while Mr. 
Hubbell was a target of a separate criminal investigation into his own conduct. 
The OIC also possessed evidence that the President and the First Lady knew and 
approved of the Hubbell-focused assistance. 
<P>Specifically, in the wake of his April 1994 resignation from the Justice 
Department, Mr. Hubbell launched a private consulting practice in Washington, 
D.C. In the startup process, Mr. Hubbell received substantial aid from important 
public and private figures. On the day prior to Mr. Hubbell announcing his 
resignation, White House Chief of Staff Thomas "Mack" McLarty attended a meeting 
at the White House with the President, First Lady, and others, where Mr. 
Hubbell's resignation was a topic of discussion. 
<P>At some point after the White House meeting, Mr. McLarty spoke with Vernon 
Jordan about Mr. Jordan's assistance to Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell. Mr. Jordan introduced 
Mr. Hubbell to senior executives at New York-based MacAndrews &amp; Forbes 
Holding Co. Mr.&nbsp;Jordan is a director of Revlon, Inc., a company controlled 
by MacAndrews &amp; Forbes. The introduction was successful; MacAndrews &amp; 
Forbes retained Mr. Hubbell at a rate of $25,000 per quarter. Vernon Jordan 
informed President Clinton that he was helping Mr.&nbsp;Hubbell.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_30_"><SUP>(30)</SUP></A> 
<P>By late 1997, this Office was investigating whether a relationship existed 
between consulting payments to Mr. Hubbell and his lack of cooperation 
(specifically, his incomplete testimony) with the OIC's investigation.<A 
href="5intro.htm#N_31_"><SUP>(31)</SUP></A> In 
particular, the OIC was investigating whether Mr. Hubbell concealed information 
about certain core Arkansas matters, namely, the much-publicized Castle Grande 
real estate project and related legal work by the Rose Law Firm, including the 
First Lady. 
<P>Against this background, the OIC considered the January 1998 allegations 
that: (i) Ms. Lewinsky was prepared to lie in order to benefit the President, 
and (ii) Vernon Jordan was assisting Ms. Lewinsky in the <U>Jones</U> 
litigation, while simultaneously helping her apply for a private-sector job 
with, among others, Revlon, Inc. 
<P>Based in part on these similarities, the OIC undertook a preliminary 
investigation. On January 15, 1998, this Office informed the Justice Department 
of the results of our inquiry. The Attorney General immediately applied to the 
Special Division of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
for an expansion of the OIC's jurisdiction. The Special Division granted this 
request and authorized the OIC to determine whether Monica Lewinsky or others 
had violated federal law in connection with the <U>Jones v. Clinton</U> case. 
<P><A name=L7><STRONG>2. Current Status of the Investigation.</STRONG> When the 
OIC's jurisdiction was expanded to cover the Lewinsky matter in January 1998, 
several matters remained under active investigation by this Office. Evidence was 
being gathered and evaluated on, among other things, events related to the Rose 
Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan Association; 
events related to the firings in the White House Travel Office; and events 
related to the use of FBI files. Since the current phase of the investigation 
began, additional events arising from the Lewinsky matter have also come under 
scrutiny, including possible perjury and obstruction of justice related to 
former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey, and the possible misuse of the 
personnel records of Pentagon employee Linda Tripp. 
<P>From the outset, it was our strong desire to complete all phases of the 
investigation before deciding whether to submit to Congress information -- if 
any -- that may constitute grounds for an impeachment. But events and the 
statutory command of Section 595(c) have dictated otherwise. As the 
investigation into the President's actions with respect to Ms. Lewinsky and the 
<U>Jones</U> litigation progressed, it became apparent that there was a 
significant body of substantial and credible information that met the Section 
595(c) threshold. As that phase of the investigation neared completion, it also 
became apparent that a delay of this Referral until the evidence from all phases 
of the investigation had been evaluated would be unwise. Although Section 595(c) 
does not specify when information must be submitted, its text strongly suggests 
that information of this type belongs in the hands of Congress as soon as the 
Independent Counsel determines that the information is reliable and 
substantially complete. 
<P>All phases of the investigation are now nearing completion. This Office will 
soon make final decisions about what steps to take, if any, with respect to the 
other information it has gathered. Those decisions will be made at the earliest 
practical time, consistent with our statutory and ethical obligations. 
<P align=center><A name=L8><STRONG>The Contents of the Referral</STRONG> 
<P>The Referral consists of several parts. Part One is a Narrative. It begins 
with an overview of the information relevant to this investigation, then sets 
forth that information in chronological sequence. A large part of the Narrative 
is devoted to a description of the President's relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky. The nature of the relationship was the subject of many of the 
President's false statements, and his desire to keep the relationship secret 
provides a motive for many of his actions that apparently were designed to 
obstruct justice. 
<P>The Narrative is lengthy and detailed. It is the view of this Office that the 
details are crucial to an informed evaluation of the testimony, the credibility 
of witnesses, and the reliability of other evidence. Many of the details reveal 
highly personal information; many are sexually explicit. This is unfortunate, 
but it is essential. The President's defense to many of the allegations is based 
on a close parsing of the definitions that were used to describe his conduct. We 
have, after careful review, identified no manner of providing the information 
that reveals the falsity of the President's statements other than to describe 
his conduct with precision. 
<P>Part Two of the Referral is entitled "Information that May Constitute Grounds 
for An Impeachment." This "Grounds" portion of the Referral summarizes the 
specific evidence that the President lied under oath and attempted to obstruct 
justice. This Part is designed to be understandable if read without the 
Narrative, although the full context in which the potential grounds for 
impeachment arise can best be understood if considered against the backdrop of 
information set forth in Part One. 
<P>Several volumes accompany the Referral. The Appendix contains relevant court 
orders, tables, a discussion of legal and evidentiary issues, background 
information on the <U>Jones</U> litigation, a diagram of the Oval Office, and 
other reference material. We next set forth a series of "Document Supplements," 
which attempt to provide some of the most important support material in an 
accessible format. Document Supplement A contains transcripts of the President's 
deposition testimony and grand jury testimony; Document Supplement B contains 
transcripts of Monica Lewinsky's testimony and interview statements. Document 
Supplements C, D, and E set forth the full text of the documents cited in the 
Referral. Although every effort has been made to provide full and accurate 
quotations of witnesses in their proper context, we urge review of the full 
transcripts of the testimony cited below.

discovery, not admissibility of evidence at trial. Discovery, as all counsel

numerous paths, and whether those paths lead to the discovery of admissible

proceedings was significant. Witnesses called before the grand jury in the 
criminal investigation had been subpoenaed by both parties to the civil case; 
defendant's counsel had subpoenaed information from the OIC; and the plaintiff's 
attorneys had subpoenaed documents directly related to the criminal matter.

<P><A name=N_18_>18. </A>In the course of its investigation, the OIC gathered 
information from a variety of sources, including the testimony of witnesses 
before the grand jury. Normally a federal prosecutor is prohibited by Rule 6(e) 
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure from disclosing grand jury material, 
unless it obtains permission from a court or is otherwise authorized by law to 
do so. This Office concluded that the statutory obligation of disclosure imposed 
on an Independent Counsel by 28 U.S.C. ß595(c) grants such authority. 
Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, the OIC obtained permission from 
the Special Division to disclose grand jury material as appropriate in carrying 
out its statutory duty. A copy of the disclosure order entered by the Special 
Division is set forth in the Appendix, Tab B. We also advised Chief Judge Norma 
Holloway Johnson, who supervises the principal grand jury in this matter, of our 
determination on that issue.

<P><A name=N_21_>21. </A>Before the grand jury, the President refused to answer 
certain questions about his conduct with Ms. Lewinsky on the ground that he 
believed the inquiries were unnecessary "and . . . I think, frankly, go too far 
in trying to criminalize my private life." Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 94. <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Others have argued that alleged "lies about sex" have nothing to do with the 
President's performance in office, and thus, are inconsequential. Former White 
House Counsel Jack Quinn articulated this view: <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>This is a matter of sex between consenting adults, and the question of 
whether or not one or the other was truthful about it. . . . This doesn't go to 
the question of his conduct in office. And, in that sense, it's trivial. <BR

<P>The President echoed this theme in his address to the Nation on August 17, 
1998, following his grand jury testimony: <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>. . . I intend to reclaim my family life for my family. It's nobody's 
business but ours. Even Presidents have private lives. It is time to stop the 
pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private lives and get on 
with our national life. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">

noted: "[T]o the extent that discovery is permitted with respect to the sexual 
activities of either the complainant or the alleged harasser, courts likely will 
freely entertain motions to limit the availability of such information to the 
parties and their counsel and to prohibit general dissemination of such 
sensitive data to third parties." <U>See</U> Barbara Lindeman &amp; David D. 
Kadue, <U>Sexual Harassment in Employment Law</U> 563 (1992). 
<P><A name=N_23_>23. </A>A sexual harassment case can sometimes boil down to a 
credibility battle between the parties, in which "the existence of corroborative 
evidence or the lack thereof is likely to be crucial." <U>Henson v. City of 
Dundee</U>, 682 F.2d 897, 912 n.25 (11th Cir. 1982). If there are no 
eyewitnesses, it can be critical for a plaintiff to learn in discovery whether 
the defendant has committed the same kind of acts before or since. Thus, the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission explained in a 1990 policy statement 
that the plaintiff's allegations of an incident of sexual harassment "would be 
further buttressed if other employees testified that the supervisor 
propositioned them as well." EEOC Policy Guidance (1990). The rules of evidence 
establish that such corroboration may be used to show the defendant's "motive, 
opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of 
mistake or accident." Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). In short, a defendant's sexual 
history, at least with respect to other employees, is ordinarily discoverable in 
a sexual harassment suit.

somehow distinct from "obstruction of justice." While the crimes are distinct, 
they are in fact variations on a single theme: preventing a court, the parties, 
and the public from discovering the truth. Perjury, subornation of perjury, 
concealment of subpoenaed documents, and witness tampering are all forms of 
obstruction of justice.
