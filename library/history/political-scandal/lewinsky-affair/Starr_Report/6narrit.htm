<CENTER>Relationship with Monica Lewinsky </STRONG></CENTER><BR wp="br1"><BR 
wp="br2">
<P><A name=L3><STRONG>A. Introduction</STRONG> 
<P>This Referral presents substantial and credible information that President 
Clinton criminally obstructed the judicial process, first in a sexual harassment 
lawsuit in which he was the defendant and then in a grand jury investigation. 
The opening section of the Narrative provides an overview of the object of the 
President's cover-up, the sexual relationship between the President and Ms. 
Lewinsky. Subsequent sections recount the evolution of the relationship 
chronologically, including the sexual contacts, the President's efforts to get 
Ms. Lewinsky a job, Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena in <U>Jones v. Clinton</U>, the role 
of Vernon Jordan, the President's discussions with Ms. Lewinsky about her 
affidavit and deposition, the President's deposition testimony in <U>Jones</U>, 
the President's attempts to coach a potential witness in the harassment case, 
the President's false and misleading statements to aides and to the American 
public after the Lewinsky story became public, and, finally, the President's 
testimony before a federal grand jury. 
<P><A name=L4><STRONG>B. Evidence Establishing Nature of Relationship </STRONG>
<P><A name=L5><STRONG>1. Physical Evidence</STRONG> 
<P>Physical evidence conclusively establishes that the President and Ms. 
Lewinsky had a sexual relationship. After reaching an immunity and cooperation 
agreement with the Office of the Independent Counsel on July 28, 1998, Ms. 
Lewinsky turned over a navy blue dress that she said she had worn during a 
sexual encounter with the President on February 28, 1997. According to Ms. 
Lewinsky, she noticed stains on the garment the next time she took it from her 
closet. From their location, she surmised that the stains were the President's 
semen.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> 
<P>Initial tests revealed that the stains are in fact semen.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> Based 
on that result, the OIC asked the President for a blood sample.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> After 
requesting and being given assurances that the OIC had an evidentiary basis for 
making the request, the President agreed.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> In the 
White House Map Room on August 3, 1998, the White House Physician drew a vial of 
blood from the President in the presence of an FBI agent and an OIC attorney.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> By 
conducting the two standard DNA comparison tests, the FBI Laboratory concluded 
that the President was the source of the DNA obtained from the dress.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> 
According to the more sensitive RFLP test, the genetic markers on the semen, 
which match the President's DNA, are characteristic of one out of 7.87 trillion 
Caucasians.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> 
<P>In addition to the dress, Ms. Lewinsky provided what she said were answering 
machine tapes containing brief messages from the President, as well as several 
gifts that the President had given her. 
<P><A name=L6><STRONG>2. Ms. Lewinsky's Statements </STRONG>
<P>Ms. Lewinsky was extensively debriefed about her relationship with the 
President. For the initial evaluation of her credibility, she submitted to a 
detailed "proffer" interview on July 27, 1998.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A> After 
entering into a cooperation agreement, she was questioned over the course of 
approximately 15 days. She also provided testimony under oath on three 
occasions: twice before the grand jury, and, because of the personal and 
sensitive nature of particular topics, once in a deposition. In addition, Ms. 
Lewinsky worked with prosecutors and investigators to create an 11-page chart 
that chronologically lists her contacts with President Clinton, including 
meetings, phone calls, gifts, and messages.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> Ms. 
Lewinsky twice verified the accuracy of the chart under oath.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A> 
<P>In the evaluation of experienced prosecutors and investigators, Ms. Lewinsky 
has provided truthful information. She has not falsely inculpated the President. 
Harming him, she has testified, is "the last thing in the world I want to do."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A> 
<P>Moreover, the OIC's immunity and cooperation agreement with Ms. Lewinsky 
includes safeguards crafted to ensure that she tells the truth. Court-ordered 
immunity and written immunity agreements often provide that the witness can be 
prosecuted only for false statements made during the period of cooperation, and 
not for the underlying offense. The OIC's agreement goes further, providing that 
Ms. Lewinsky will lose her immunity altogether if the government can prove to a 
federal district judge -- by a preponderance of the evidence, not the higher 
standard of beyond a reasonable doubt -- that she lied. Moreover, the agreement 
provides that, in the course of such a prosecution, the United States could 
introduce into evidence the statements made by Ms. Lewinsky during her 
cooperation. Since Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged in her proffer interview and in 
debriefings that she violated the law, she has a strong incentive to tell the 
truth: If she did not, it would be relatively straightforward to void the 
immunity agreement and prosecute her, using her own admissions against her. 
<P><A name=L7><STRONG>3. Ms. Lewinsky's Confidants</STRONG> 
<P>Between 1995 and 1998, Ms. Lewinsky confided in 11 people about her 
relationship with the President. All have been questioned by the OIC, most 
before a federal grand jury: Andrew Bleiler, Catherine Allday Davis, Neysa 
Erbland, Kathleen Estep, Deborah Finerman, Dr. Irene Kassorla, Marcia Lewis, 
Ashley Raines, Linda Tripp, Natalie Ungvari, and Dale Young.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_12_"><SUP>(12)</SUP></A> Ms. 
Lewinsky told most of these confidants about events in her relationship with the 
President as they occurred, sometimes in considerable detail. 
<P>Some of Ms. Lewinsky's statements about the relationship were 
contemporaneously memorialized. These include deleted email recovered from her 
home computer and her Pentagon computer, email messages retained by two of the 
recipients, tape recordings of some of Ms. Lewinsky's conversations with Ms. 
Tripp, and notes taken by Ms. Tripp during some of their conversations. The 
Tripp notes, which have been extensively corroborated, refer specifically to 
places, dates, and times of physical contacts between the President and Ms. 
Lewinsky.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_13_"><SUP>(13)</SUP></A> 
<P>Everyone in whom Ms. Lewinsky confided in detail believed she was telling the 
truth about her relationship with the President. Ms. Lewinsky told her 
psychologist, Dr. Irene Kassorla, about the affair shortly after it began. 
Thereafter, she related details of sexual encounters soon after they occurred 
(sometimes calling from her White House office).<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_14_"><SUP>(14)</SUP></A> Ms. 
Lewinsky showed no indications of delusional thinking, according to Dr. 
Kassorla, and Dr. Kassorla had no doubts whatsoever about the truth of what Ms. 
Lewinsky told her.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_15_"><SUP>(15)</SUP></A> Ms. 
Lewinsky's friend Catherine Allday Davis testified that she believed Ms. 
Lewinsky's accounts of the sexual relationship with the President because "I 
trusted in the way she had confided in me on other things in her life. . . . I 
just trusted the relationship, so I trusted her."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_16_"><SUP>(16)</SUP></A> Dale 
Young, a friend in whom Ms. Lewinsky confided starting in mid-1996, testified: 
<P>[I]f she was going to lie to me, she would have said to me, "Oh, he calls me 
all the time. He does wonderful things. He can't wait to see me." . . . [S]he 
would have embellished the story. You know, she wouldn't be telling me, "He told 
me he'd call me, I waited home all weekend and I didn't do anything and he 
didn't call and then he didn't call for two weeks."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_17_"><SUP>(17)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L8><STRONG>4. Documents</STRONG> 
<P>In addition to her remarks and email to friends, Ms. Lewinsky wrote a number 
of documents, including letters and draft letters to the President. Among these 
documents are (i) papers found in a consensual search of her apartment; (ii) 
papers that Ms. Lewinsky turned over pursuant to her cooperation agreement, 
including a calendar with dates circled when she met or talked by telephone with 
the President in 1996 and 1997; and (iii) files recovered from Ms. Lewinsky's 
computers at home and at the Pentagon. 
<P><A name=L9><STRONG>5. Consistency and Corroboration</STRONG> 
<P>The details of Ms. Lewinsky's many statements have been checked, 
cross-checked, and corroborated. When negotiations with Ms. Lewinsky in January 
and February 1998 did not culminate in an agreement, the OIC proceeded with a 
comprehensive investigation, which generated a great deal of probative evidence. 

<P>In July and August 1998, circumstances brought more direct and compelling 
evidence to the investigation. After the courts rejected a novel privilege 
claim, Secret Service officers and agents testified about their observations of 
the President and Ms. Lewinsky in the White House. Ms. Lewinsky agreed to submit 
to a proffer interview (previous negotiations had deadlocked over her refusal to 
do so), and, after assessing her credibility in that session, the OIC entered 
into a cooperation agreement with her. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, 
Ms. Lewinsky turned over the dress that proved to bear traces of the President's 
semen. And the President, who had spurned six invitations to testify, finally 
agreed to provide his account to the grand jury. In that sworn testimony, he 
acknowledged "inappropriate intimate contact" with Ms. Lewinsky. 
<P>Because of the fashion in which the investigation had unfolded, in sum, a 
massive quantity of evidence was available to test and verify Ms. Lewinsky's 
statements during her proffer interview and her later cooperation. Consequently, 
Ms. Lewinsky's statements have been corroborated to a remarkable degree. Her 
detailed statements to the grand jury and the OIC in 1998 are consistent with 
statements to her confidants dating back to 1995, documents that she created, 
and physical evidence.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_18_"><SUP>(18)</SUP></A> 
Moreover, her accounts generally match the testimony of White House staff 
members; the testimony of Secret Service agents and officers; and White House 
records showing Ms. Lewinsky's entries and exits, the President's whereabouts, 
and the President's telephone calls. 
<P><A name=L10><STRONG>C. Sexual Contacts </STRONG>
<P><A name=L11><STRONG>1. The President's Accounts</STRONG> 
<P><A name=L12><STRONG>a. <U>Jones</U> Testimony </STRONG>
<P>In the <U>Jones</U> deposition on January 17, 1998, the President denied 
having had "a sexual affair," "sexual relations," or "a sexual relationship" 
with Ms. Lewinsky.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_19_"><SUP>(19)</SUP></A> He 
noted that "[t]here are no curtains on the Oval Office, there are no curtains on 
my private office, there are no curtains or blinds that can close [on] the 
windows in my private dining room," and added: "I have done everything I could 
to avoid the kind of questions you are asking me here today. . . ."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_20_"><SUP>(20)</SUP></A> 
<P>During the deposition, the President's attorney, Robert Bennett, sought to 
limit questioning about Ms. Lewinsky. Mr. Bennett told Judge Susan Webber Wright 
that Ms. Lewinsky had executed "an affidavit which [Ms. Jones's lawyers] are in 
possession of saying that there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, 
shape or form, with President Clinton." In a subsequent colloquy with Judge 
Wright, Mr. Bennett declared that as a result of "preparation of [President 
Clinton] for this deposition, the witness is fully aware of Ms. Lewinsky's 
affidavit."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_21_"><SUP>(21)</SUP></A> The 
President did not dispute his legal representative's assertion that the 
President and Ms. Lewinsky had had "absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, 
shape or form," nor did he dispute the implication that Ms. Lewinsky's 
affidavit, in denying "a sexual relationship," meant that there was "absolutely 
no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form." In subsequent questioning by 
his attorney, President Clinton testified under oath that Ms. Lewinsky's 
affidavit was "absolutely true."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_22_"><SUP>(22)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L13><STRONG>b. Grand Jury Testimony</STRONG> 
<P>Testifying before the grand jury on August 17, 1998, seven months after his 
<U>Jones</U> deposition, the President acknowledged "inappropriate intimate 
contact" with Ms. Lewinsky but maintained that his January deposition testimony 
was accurate.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_23_"><SUP>(23)</SUP></A> In 
his account, "what began as a friendship [with Ms. Lewinsky] came to include 
this conduct."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_24_"><SUP>(24)</SUP></A> He 
said he remembered "meeting her, or having my first real conversation with her 
during the government shutdown in November of '95." According to the President, 
the inappropriate contact occurred later (after Ms. Lewinsky's internship had 
ended), "in early 1996 and once in early 1997."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_25_"><SUP>(25)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President refused to answer questions about the precise nature of his 
intimate contacts with Ms. Lewinsky, but he did explain his earlier denials.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_26_"><SUP>(26)</SUP></A> As 
to his denial in the <U>Jones</U> deposition that he and Ms. Lewinsky had had a 
"sexual relationship," the President maintained that there can be no sexual 
relationship without sexual intercourse, regardless of what other sexual 
activities may transpire. He stated that "most ordinary Americans" would embrace 
this distinction.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_27_"><SUP>(27)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President also maintained that none of his sexual contacts with Ms. 
Lewinsky constituted "sexual relations" within a specific definition used in the 
<U>Jones</U> deposition.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_28_"><SUP>(28)</SUP></A> 
Under that definition: 
<P>[A] person engages in "sexual relations" when the person knowingly engages in 
or causes -- (1) contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, 
or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire 
of any person . . . . "Contact" means intentional touching, either directly or 
through clothing.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_29_"><SUP>(29)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>According to what the President testified was his understanding, this 
definition "covers contact by the person being deposed with the enumerated 
areas, if the contact is done with an intent to arouse or gratify," but it does 
not cover oral sex performed on the person being deposed.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_30_"><SUP>(30)</SUP></A> He 
testified: 
<P>[I]f the deponent is the person who has oral sex performed on him, then the 
contact is with -- not with anything on that list, but with the lips of another 
person. It seems to be self-evident that that's what it is. . . . Let me remind 
you, sir, I read this carefully.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_31_"><SUP>(31)</SUP></A> <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>In the President's view, "any person, reasonable person" would recognize that 
oral sex performed on the deponent falls outside the definition.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_32_"><SUP>(32)</SUP></A> 
<P>If Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex on the President, then -- under this 
interpretation -- she engaged in sexual relations but he did not. The President 
refused to answer whether Ms. Lewinsky in fact had performed oral sex on him.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_33_"><SUP>(33)</SUP></A> He 
did testify that direct contact with Ms. Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia would 
fall within the definition, and he denied having had any such contact.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_34_"><SUP>(34)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L14><STRONG>2. Ms. Lewinsky's Account</STRONG> 
<P>In his grand jury testimony, the President relied heavily on a particular 
interpretation of "sexual relations" as defined in the <U>Jones</U> deposition. 
Beyond insisting that his conduct did not fall within the <U>Jones</U> 
definition, he refused to answer questions about the nature of his physical 
contact with Ms. Lewinsky, thus placing the grand jury in the position of having 
to accept his conclusion without being able to explore the underlying facts. 
This strategy -- evidently an effort to account for possible traces of the 
President's semen on Ms. Lewinsky's clothing without undermining his position 
that he did not lie in the <U>Jones</U> deposition -- mandates that this 
Referral set forth evidence of an explicit nature that otherwise would be 
omitted. 
<P>In light of the President's testimony, Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of their 
sexual encounters are indispensable for two reasons. First, the detail and 
consistency of these accounts tend to bolster Ms. Lewinsky's credibility. 
Second, and particularly important, Ms. Lewinsky contradicts the President on a 
key issue. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President touched her breasts and 
genitalia -- which means that his conduct met the <U>Jones</U> definition of 
sexual relations even under his theory. On these matters, the evidence of the 
President's perjury cannot be presented without specific, explicit, and possibly 
offensive descriptions of sexual encounters. 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had ten sexual encounters, 
eight while she worked at the White House and two thereafter.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_35_"><SUP>(35)</SUP></A> The 
sexual encounters generally occurred in or near the private study off the Oval 
Office -- most often in the windowless hallway outside the study.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_36_"><SUP>(36)</SUP></A> 
During many of their sexual encounters, the President stood leaning against the 
doorway of the bathroom across from the study, which, he told Ms. Lewinsky, 
eased his sore back.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_37_"><SUP>(37)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that her physical relationship with the President 
included oral sex but not sexual intercourse.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_38_"><SUP>(38)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms. Lewinsky, she performed oral sex on the President; he never 
performed oral sex on her.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_39_"><SUP>(39)</SUP></A> 
Initially, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President would not let her perform 
oral sex to completion. In Ms. Lewinsky's understanding, his refusal was related 
to "trust and not knowing me well enough."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_40_"><SUP>(40)</SUP></A> 
During their last two sexual encounters, both in 1997, he did ejaculate.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_41_"><SUP>(41)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she performed oral sex on the President on nine 
occasions. On all nine of those occasions, the President fondled and kissed her 
bare breasts. He touched her genitals, both through her underwear and directly, 
bringing her to orgasm on two occasions. On one occasion, the President inserted 
a cigar into her vagina. On another occasion, she and the President had brief 
genital-to-genital contact.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_42_"><SUP>(42)</SUP></A> 
<P>Whereas the President testified that "what began as a friendship came to 
include [intimate contact]," Ms. Lewinsky explained that the relationship moved 
in the opposite direction: "[T]he emotional and friendship aspects . . . 
developed after the beginning of our sexual relationship."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_43_"><SUP>(43)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L15><STRONG>D. Emotional Attachment</STRONG> 
<P>As the relationship developed over time, Ms. Lewinsky grew emotionally 
attached to President Clinton. She testified: "I never expected to fall in love 
with the President. I was surprised that I did."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_44_"><SUP>(44)</SUP></A> Ms. 
Lewinsky told him of her feelings.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_45_"><SUP>(45)</SUP></A> At 
times, she believed that he loved her too.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_46_"><SUP>(46)</SUP></A> They 
were physically affectionate: "A lot of hugging, holding hands sometimes. He 
always used to push the hair out of my face."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_47_"><SUP>(47)</SUP></A> She 
called him "Handsome"; on occasion, he called her "Sweetie," "Baby," or 
sometimes "Dear."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_48_"><SUP>(48)</SUP></A> He 
told her that he enjoyed talking to her -- she recalled his saying that the two 
of them were "emotive and full of fire," and she made him feel young.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_49_"><SUP>(49)</SUP></A> He 
said he wished he could spend more time with her.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_50_"><SUP>(50)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky told confidants of the emotional underpinnings of the 
relationship as it evolved. According to her mother, Marcia Lewis, the President 
once told Ms. Lewinsky that she "had been hurt a lot or something by different 
men and that he would be her friend or he would help her, not hurt her."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_51_"><SUP>(51)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms. Lewinsky's friend Neysa Erbland, President Clinton once 
confided in Ms. Lewinsky that he was uncertain whether he would remain married 
after he left the White House. He said in essence, "[W]ho knows what will happen 
four years from now when I am out of office?" Ms. Lewinsky thought, according to 
Ms. Erbland, that "maybe she will be his wife."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_52_"><SUP>(52)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L16><STRONG>E. Conversations and Phone Messages </STRONG>
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and the President "enjoyed talking to each 
other and being with each other." In her recollection, "We would tell jokes. We 
would talk about our childhoods. Talk about current events. I was always giving 
him my stupid ideas about what I thought should be done in the administration or 
different views on things."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_53_"><SUP>(53)</SUP></A> One 
of Ms. Lewinsky's friends testified that, in her understanding, "[The President] 
would talk about his childhood and growing up, and [Ms. Lewinsky] would relay 
stories about her childhood and growing up. I guess normal conversations that 
you would have with someone that you're getting to know."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_54_"><SUP>(54)</SUP></A> 
<P>The longer conversations often occurred after their sexual contact. Ms. 
Lewinsky testified: "[W]hen I was working there [at the White House] . . . we'd 
start in the back [in or near the private study] and we'd talk and that was 
where we were physically intimate, and we'd usually end up, kind of the pillow 
talk of it, I guess, . . . sitting in the Oval Office . . . ."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_55_"><SUP>(55)</SUP></A> 
During several meetings when they were not sexually intimate, they talked in the 
Oval Office or in the area of the study.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_56_"><SUP>(56)</SUP></A> 
<P>Along with face-to-face meetings, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she spoke on the 
telephone with the President approximately 50 times, often after 10 p.m. and 
sometimes well after midnight.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_57_"><SUP>(57)</SUP></A> The 
President placed the calls himself or, during working hours, had his secretary, 
Betty Currie, do so; Ms. Lewinsky could not telephone him directly, though she 
sometimes reached him through Ms. Currie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_58_"><SUP>(58)</SUP></A> Ms. 
Lewinsky testified: "[W]e spent hours on the phone talking."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_59_"><SUP>(59)</SUP></A> 
Their telephone conversations were "[s]imilar to what we discussed in person, 
just how we were doing. A lot of discussions about my job, when I was trying to 
come back to the White House and then once I decided to move to New York. . . . 
We talked about everything under the sun."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_60_"><SUP>(60)</SUP></A> On 
10 to 15 occasions, she and the President had phone sex.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_61_"><SUP>(61)</SUP></A> 
After phone sex late one night, the President fell asleep mid-conversation.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_62_"><SUP>(62)</SUP></A> 
<P>On four occasions, the President left very brief messages on Ms. Lewinsky's 
answering machine, though he told her that he did not like doing so because (in 
her recollection) he "felt it was a little unsafe."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_63_"><SUP>(63)</SUP></A> She 
saved his messages and played the tapes for several confidants, who said they 
believed that the voice was the President's.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_64_"><SUP>(64)</SUP></A> 
<P>By phone and in person, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President 
sometimes had arguments. On a number of occasions in 1997, she complained that 
he had not brought her back from the Pentagon to work in the White House, as he 
had promised to do after the election.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_65_"><SUP>(65)</SUP></A> In a 
face-to-face meeting on July 4, 1997, the President reprimanded her for a letter 
she had sent him that obliquely threatened to disclose their relationship.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_66_"><SUP>(66)</SUP></A> 
During an argument on December 6, 1997, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President 
said that "he had never been treated as poorly by anyone else as I treated him," 
and added that "he spent more time with me than anyone else in the world, aside 
from his family, friends and staff, which I don't know exactly which category 
that put me in."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_67_"><SUP>(67)</SUP></A> 
<P>Testifying before the grand jury, the President confirmed that he and Ms. 
Lewinsky had had personal conversations, and he acknowledged that their 
telephone conversations sometimes included "inappropriate sexual banter."<A

President said that Ms. Lewinsky told him about "her personal life," "her 
upbringing," and "her job ambitions."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_69_"><SUP>(69)</SUP></A> 
After terminating their intimate relationship in 1997, he said, he tried "to be 
a friend to Ms. Lewinsky, to be a counselor to her, to give her good advice, and 
to help her."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_70_"><SUP>(70)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L17><STRONG>F. Gifts</STRONG> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky and the President exchanged numerous gifts. By her estimate, she 
gave him about 30 items, and he gave her about 18.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_71_"><SUP>(71)</SUP></A> Ms. 
Lewinsky's first gift to him was a matted poem given by her and other White 
House interns to commemorate "National Boss Day," October 24, 1995.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_72_"><SUP>(72)</SUP></A> This 
was the only item reflected in White House records that Ms. Lewinsky gave the 
President before (in her account) the sexual relationship began, and the only 
item that he sent to the archives instead of keeping.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_73_"><SUP>(73)</SUP></A> On 
November 20 -- five days after the intimate relationship began, according to Ms. 
Lewinsky -- she gave him a necktie, which he chose to keep rather than send to 
the archives.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_74_"><SUP>(74)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned the night she gave him the 
tie, then sent her a photo of himself wearing it.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_75_"><SUP>(75)</SUP></A> The 
tie was logged pursuant to White House procedures for gifts to the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_76_"><SUP>(76)</SUP></A> 
<P>In a draft note to the President in December 1997, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that 
she was "very particular about presents and could never give them to anyone else 
-- they were all bought with you in mind."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_77_"><SUP>(77)</SUP></A> Many 
of the 30 or so gifts that she gave the President reflected his interests in 
history, antiques, cigars, and frogs. Ms. Lewinsky gave him, among other things, 
six neckties, an antique paperweight showing the White House, a silver tabletop 
holder for cigars or cigarettes, a pair of sunglasses, a casual shirt, a mug 
emblazoned "Santa Monica," a frog figurine, a letter opener depicting a frog, 
several novels, a humorous book of quotations, and several antique books.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_78_"><SUP>(78)</SUP></A> He 
gave her, among other things, a hat pin, two brooches, a blanket, a marble bear 
figurine, and a special edition of Walt Whitman's <U>Leaves of Grass</U>.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_79_"><SUP>(79)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky construed it as a sign of affection when the President wore a 
necktie or other item of clothing she had given him. She testified: "I used to 
say to him that 'I like it when you wear my ties because then I know I'm close 
to your heart.' So -- literally and figuratively."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_80_"><SUP>(80)</SUP></A> The 
President was aware of her reaction, according to Ms. Lewinsky, and he would 
sometimes wear one of the items to reassure her -- occasionally on the day they 
were scheduled to meet or the day after they had met in person or talked by 
telephone.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_81_"><SUP>(81)</SUP></A> The 
President would sometimes say to her, "Did you see I wore your tie the other 
day?"<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_82_"><SUP>(82)</SUP></A> 
<P>In his grand jury testimony, the President acknowledged that he had exchanged 
a number of gifts with Ms. Lewinsky. After their intimate relationship ended in 
1997, he testified, "[S]he continued to give me gifts. And I felt that it was a 
right thing to do to give her gifts back."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_83_"><SUP>(83)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L18><STRONG>G. Messages</STRONG> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she sent the President a number of cards and 
letters. In some, she expressed anger that he was "not paying enough attention 
to me"; in others, she said she missed him; in still others, she just sent "a 
funny card that I saw."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_84_"><SUP>(84)</SUP></A> In 
early January 1998, she sent him, along with an antique book about American 
presidents, "[a]n embarrassing mushy note."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_85_"><SUP>(85)</SUP></A> She 
testified that the President never sent her any cards or notes other than formal 
thank-you letters.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_86_"><SUP>(86)</SUP></A> 
<P>Testifying before the grand jury, the President acknowledged having received 
cards and notes from Ms. Lewinsky that were "somewhat intimate" and "quite 
affectionate," even after the intimate relationship ended.<A

<P><A name=L19><STRONG>H. Secrecy</STRONG> 
<P><A name=L20><STRONG>1. Mutual Understanding </STRONG>
<P>Both Ms. Lewinsky and the President testified that they took steps to 
maintain the secrecy of the relationship. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the 
President from the outset stressed the importance of keeping the relationship 
secret. In her handwritten statement to this Office, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that 
"the President told Ms. L to deny a relationship, if ever asked about it. He 
also said something to the effect of if the two people who are involved say it 
didn't happen -- it didn't happen."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_88_"><SUP>(88)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President sometimes asked if she had told anyone 
about their sexual relationship or about the gifts they had exchanged; she 
(falsely) assured him that she had not.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_89_"><SUP>(89)</SUP></A> She 
told him that "I would always deny it, I would always protect him," and he 
responded approvingly.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_90_"><SUP>(90)</SUP></A> The 
two of them had, in her words, "a mutual understanding" that they would "keep 
this private, so that meant deny it and . . . take whatever appropriate steps 
needed to be taken."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_91_"><SUP>(91)</SUP></A> When 
she and the President both were subpoenaed to testify in the <U>Jones</U> case, 
Ms. Lewinsky anticipated that "as we had on every other occasion and every other 
instance of this relationship, we would deny it."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_92_"><SUP>(92)</SUP></A> 
<P>In his grand jury testimony, the President confirmed his efforts to keep 
their liaisons secret.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_93_"><SUP>(93)</SUP></A> He 
said he did not want the facts of their relationship to be disclosed "in any 
context," and added: "I certainly didn't want this to come out, if I could help 
it. And I was concerned about that. I was embarrassed about it. I knew it was 
wrong."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_94_"><SUP>(94)</SUP></A> 
Asked if he wanted to avoid having the facts come out through Ms. Lewinsky's 
testimony in <U>Jones</U>, he said: "Well, I did not want her to have to testify 
and go through that. And, of course, I didn't want her to do that, of course 
not."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_95_"><SUP>(95)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L21><STRONG>2. Cover Stories</STRONG> 
<P>For her visits to see the President, according to Ms. Lewinsky, "[T]here was 
always some sort of a cover."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_96_"><SUP>(96)</SUP></A> When 
visiting the President while she worked at the White House, she generally 
planned to tell anyone who asked (including Secret Service officers and agents) 
that she was delivering papers to the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_97_"><SUP>(97)</SUP></A> Ms. 
Lewinsky explained that this artifice may have originated when "I got there kind 
of saying, 'Oh, gee, here are your letters,' wink, wink, wink, and him saying, 
'Okay, that's good.'"<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_98_"><SUP>(98)</SUP></A> To 
back up her stories, she generally carried a folder on these visits.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_99_"><SUP>(99)</SUP></A> (In 
truth, according to Ms. Lewinsky, her job never required her to deliver papers 
to the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_100_"><SUP>(100)</SUP></A>) 
On a few occasions during her White House employment, Ms. Lewinsky and the 
President arranged to bump into each other in the hallway; he then would invite 
her to accompany him to the Oval Office.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_101_"><SUP>(101)</SUP></A> 
Later, after she left the White House and started working at the Pentagon, Ms. 
Lewinsky relied on Ms. Currie to arrange times when she could see the President. 
The cover story for those visits was that Ms. Lewinsky was coming to see Ms. 
Currie, not the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_102_"><SUP>(102)</SUP></A> 
<P>While the President did not expressly instruct her to lie, according to Ms. 
Lewinsky, he did suggest misleading cover stories.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_103_"><SUP>(103)</SUP></A> 
And, when she assured him that she planned to lie about the relationship, he 
responded approvingly. On the frequent occasions when Ms. Lewinsky promised that 
she would "always deny" the relationship and "always protect him," for example, 
the President responded, in her recollection, "'That's good,' or -- something 
affirmative. . . . [N]ot -- 'Don't deny it.'"<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_104_"><SUP>(104)</SUP></A> 
<P>Once she was named as a possible witness in the <U>Jones</U> case, according 
to Ms. Lewinsky, the President reminded her of the cover stories. After telling 
her that she was a potential witness, the President suggested that, if she were 
subpoenaed, she could file an affidavit to avoid being deposed. He also told her 
she could say that, when working at the White House, she had sometimes delivered 
letters to him, and, after leaving her White House job, she had sometimes 
returned to visit Ms. Currie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_105_"><SUP>(105)</SUP></A> 
(The President's own testimony in the <U>Jones</U> case mirrors the 
recommendations he made to Ms. Lewinsky for her testimony. In his deposition, 
the President testified that he saw Ms. Lewinsky "on two or three occasions" 
during the November 1995 government furlough, "one or two other times when she 
brought some documents to me," and "sometime before Christmas" when Ms. Lewinsky 
"came by to see Betty."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_106_"><SUP>(106)</SUP></A>) 
<P>In his grand jury testimony, the President acknowledged that he and Ms. 
Lewinsky "might have talked about what to do in a nonlegal context" to hide 
their relationship, and that he "might well have said" that Ms. Lewinsky should 
tell people that she was bringing letters to him or coming to visit Ms. 
Currie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_107_"><SUP>(107)</SUP></A> 
But he also stated that "I never asked Ms. Lewinsky to lie."<A

<P><A name=L22><STRONG>3. Steps to Avoid Being Seen or Heard </STRONG>
<P>After their first two sexual encounters during the November 1995 government 
shutdown, according to Ms. Lewinsky, her encounters with the President generally 
occurred on weekends, when fewer people were in the West Wing.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_109_"><SUP>(109)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky testified: 
<P>He had told me . . . that he was usually around on the weekends and that it 
was okay to come see him on the weekends. So he would call and we would arrange 
either to bump into each other in the hall or that I would bring papers to the 
office.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_110_"><SUP>(110)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>From some of the President's comments, Ms. Lewinsky gathered that she should 
try to avoid being seen by several White House employees, including Nancy 
Hernreich, Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Oval Office 
Operations, and Stephen Goodin, the President's personal aide.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_111_"><SUP>(111)</SUP></A> 
<P>Out of concern about being seen, the sexual encounters most often occurred in 
the windowless hallway outside the study.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_112_"><SUP>(112)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President was concerned that the two of them 
might be spotted through a White House window. When they were in the study 
together in the evenings, he sometimes turned out the light.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_113_"><SUP>(113)</SUP></A> 
Once, when she spotted a gardener outside the study window, they left the 
room.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_114_"><SUP>(114)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky testified that, on December 28, 1997, "when I was getting my 
Christmas kiss" in the doorway to the study, the President was "looking out the 
window with his eyes wide open while he was kissing me and then I got mad 
because it wasn't very romantic." He responded, "Well, I was just looking to see 
to make sure no one was out there."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_115_"><SUP>(115)</SUP></A> 
<P>Fear of discovery constrained their sexual encounters in several respects, 
according to Ms. Lewinsky. The President ordinarily kept the door between the 
private hallway and the Oval Office several inches ajar during their encounters, 
both so that he could hear if anyone approached and so that anyone who did 
approach would be less likely to suspect impropriety.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_116_"><SUP>(116)</SUP></A> 
During their sexual encounters, Ms. Lewinsky testified, "[W]e were both aware of 
the volume and sometimes . . . I bit my hand -- so that I wouldn't make any 
noise."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_117_"><SUP>(117)</SUP></A> On 
one occasion, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President put his hand over her 
mouth during a sexual encounter to keep her quiet.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_118_"><SUP>(118)</SUP></A> 
Concerned that they might be interrupted abruptly, according to Ms. Lewinsky, 
the two of them never fully undressed.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_119_"><SUP>(119)</SUP></A> 
<P>While noting that "the door to the hallway was always somewhat open," the 
President testified that he did try to keep the intimate relationship secret: "I 
did what people do when they do the wrong thing. I tried to do it where nobody 
else was looking at it."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_120_"><SUP>(120)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L23><STRONG>4. Ms. Lewinsky's Notes and Letters </STRONG>
<P>The President expressed concern about documents that might hint at an 
improper relationship between them, according to Ms. Lewinsky. He cautioned her 
about messages she sent: 
<P>There were . . . some occasions when I sent him cards or notes that I wrote 
things that he deemed too personal to put on paper just in case something ever 
happened, if it got lost getting there or someone else opened it. So there were 
several times when he remarked to me, you know, you shouldn't put that on 
paper.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_121_"><SUP>(121)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>She said that the President made this point to her in their last 
conversation, on January 5, 1998, in reference to what she characterized as 
"[a]n embarrassing mushy note" she had sent him.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_122_"><SUP>(122)</SUP></A> In 
addition, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President expressed concerns about 
official records that could establish aspects of their relationship. She said 
that on two occasions she asked the President if she could go upstairs to the 
Residence with him. No, he said, because a record is kept of everyone who 
accompanies him there.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_123_"><SUP>(123)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President testified before the grand jury: "I remember telling her she 
should be careful what she wrote, because a lot of it was clearly inappropriate 
and would be embarrassing if somebody else read it."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_124_"><SUP>(124)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L24><STRONG>5. Ms. Lewinsky's Evaluation of Their Secrecy 
Efforts</STRONG> 
<P>In two conversations recorded after she was subpoenaed in the <U>Jones</U> 
case, Ms. Lewinsky expressed confidence that her relationship with the President 
would never be discovered.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_125_"><SUP>(125)</SUP></A> 
She believed that no records showed her and the President alone in the area of 
the study.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_126_"><SUP>(126)</SUP></A> 
Regardless of the evidence, in any event, she would continue denying the 
relationship. "If someone looked in the study window, it's not me," she said.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_127_"><SUP>(127)</SUP></A> If 
someone produced tapes of her telephone calls with the President, she would say 
they were fakes.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_128_"><SUP>(128)</SUP></A> 
<P>In another recorded conversation, Ms. Lewinsky said she was especially 
comforted by the fact that the President, like her, would be swearing under oath 
that "nothing happened."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_129_"><SUP>(129)</SUP></A> 
She said: 
<P>[T]o tell you the truth, I'm not concerned all that much anymore because I 
know I'm not going to get in trouble. I will not get in trouble because you know 
what? The story I've signed under -- under oath is what someone else is saying 
under oath.<A

Encounters</STRONG><STRONG></CENTER></STRONG>
<P>Monica Lewinsky began her White House employment as an intern in the Chief of 
Staff's office in July 1995. At White House functions in the following months, 
she made eye contact with the President. During the November 1995 government 
shutdown, the President invited her to his private study, where they kissed. 
Later that evening, they had a more intimate sexual encounter. They had another 
sexual encounter two days later, and a third one on New Year's Eve. 
<P><A name=L26><STRONG>A. Overview of Monica Lewinsky's White House 
Employment</STRONG> 
<P>Monica Lewinsky worked at the White House, first as an intern and then as an 
employee, from July 1995 to April 1996. With the assistance of family friend 
Walter Kaye, a prominent contributor to political causes, she obtained an 
internship starting in early July, when she was 21 years old.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_131_"><SUP>(131)</SUP></A> 
She was assigned to work on correspondence in the office of Chief of Staff Leon 
Panetta in the Old Executive Office Building.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_132_"><SUP>(132)</SUP></A> 
<P>As her internship was winding down, Ms. Lewinsky applied for a paying job on 
the White House staff. She interviewed with Timothy Keating, Special Assistant 
to the President and Staff Director for Legislative Affairs.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_133_"><SUP>(133)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky accepted a position dealing with correspondence in the Office of 
Legislative Affairs on November 13, 1995, but did not start the job (and, thus, 
continued her internship) until November 26.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_134_"><SUP>(134)</SUP></A> 
She remained a White House employee until April 1996, when -- in her view, 
because of her intimate relationship with the President -- she was dismissed 
from the White House and transferred to the Pentagon.<A

<P><A name=L27><STRONG>B. First Meetings with the President</STRONG> 
<P>The month after her White House internship began, Ms. Lewinsky and the 
President began what she characterized as "intense flirting."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_136_"><SUP>(136)</SUP></A> At 
departure ceremonies and other events, she made eye contact with him, shook 
hands, and introduced herself.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_137_"><SUP>(137)</SUP></A> 
When she ran into the President in the West Wing basement and introduced herself 
again, according to Ms. Lewinsky, he responded that he already knew who she 
was.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_138_"><SUP>(138)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky told her aunt that the President "seemed attracted to her or 
interested in her or something," and told a visiting friend that "she was 
attracted to [President Clinton], she had a big crush on him, and I think she 
told me she at some point had gotten his attention, that there was some mutual 
eye contact and recognition, mutual acknowledgment."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_139_"><SUP>(139)</SUP></A> 
<P>In the autumn of 1995, an impasse over the budget forced the federal 
government to shut down for one week, from Tuesday, November 14, to Monday, 
November 20.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_140_"><SUP>(140)</SUP></A> 
Only essential federal employees were permitted to work during the furlough, and 
the White House staff of 430 shrank to about 90 people for the week. White House 
interns could continue working because of their unpaid status, and they took on 
a wide range of additional duties.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_141_"><SUP>(141)</SUP></A> 
<P>During the shutdown, Ms. Lewinsky worked in Chief of Staff Panetta's West 
Wing office, where she answered phones and ran errands.<A

The President came to Mr. Panetta's office frequently because of the shutdown, 
and he sometimes talked with Ms. Lewinsky.<A

She characterized these encounters as "continued flirtation."<A

According to Ms. Lewinsky, a Senior Adviser to the Chief of Staff, Barry Toiv, 
remarked to her that she was getting a great deal of "face time" with the

<P><A name=L28><STRONG>C. November 15 Sexual Encounter</STRONG> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that Wednesday, November 15, 1995 -- the second day of 
the government shutdown -- marked the beginning of her sexual relationship with 
the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_146_"><SUP>(146)</SUP></A> On 
that date, she entered the White House at 1:30 p.m., left sometime thereafter 
(White House records do not show the time), reentered at 5:07 p.m., and departed 
at 12:18 a.m. on November 16.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_147_"><SUP>(147)</SUP></A> 
The President was in the Oval Office or the Chief of Staff's office (where Ms. 
Lewinsky worked during the furlough) for almost the identical period that Ms. 
Lewinsky was in the White House that evening, from 5:01 p.m. on November 15 to 
12:35 a.m. on November 16.<A

<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President made eye contact when he 
came to the West Wing to see Mr. Panetta and Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, 
then again later at an informal birthday party for Jennifer Palmieri, Special 
Assistant to the Chief of Staff.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_149_"><SUP>(149)</SUP></A> At 
one point, Ms. Lewinsky and the President talked alone in the Chief of Staff's 
office. In the course of flirting with him, she raised her jacket in the back 
and showed him the straps of her thong underwear, which extended above her 
pants.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_150_"><SUP>(150)</SUP></A> 
<P>En route to the restroom at about 8 p.m., she passed George Stephanopoulos's 
office. The President was inside alone, and he beckoned her to enter.<A

She told him that she had a crush on him. He laughed, then asked if she would 
like to see his private office.<A

Through a connecting door in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office, they went through the 
President's private dining room toward the study off the Oval Office. Ms. 
Lewinsky testified: "We talked briefly and sort of acknowledged that there had 
been a chemistry that was there before and that we were both attracted to each 
other and then he asked me if he could kiss me." Ms. Lewinsky said yes. In the 
windowless hallway adjacent to the study, they kissed.<A

They met in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office and went again to the area of the

This time the lights in the study were off.<A

Ms. Lewinsky testified: "I believe he took a phone call . . . and so we moved 
from the hallway into the back office . . . . [H]e put his hand down my pants 
and stimulated me manually in the genital area."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_161_"><SUP>(161)</SUP></A> 
While the President continued talking on the phone (Ms. Lewinsky understood that 
the caller was a Member of Congress or a Senator), she performed oral sex on 
him.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_162_"><SUP>(162)</SUP></A> He 
finished his call, and, a moment later, told Ms. Lewinsky to stop. In her 
recollection: "I told him that I wanted . . . to complete that. And he said . . 
. that he needed to wait until he trusted me more. And then I think he made a 
joke . . . that he hadn't had that in a long time."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_163_"><SUP>(163)</SUP></A> 
<P>Both before and after their sexual contact during that encounter, Ms. 
Lewinsky and the President talked.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_164_"><SUP>(164)</SUP></A> At 
one point during the conversation, the President tugged on the pink intern pass 
hanging from her neck and said that it might be a problem. Ms. Lewinsky thought 
that he was talking about access -- interns were not supposed to be in the West 
Wing without an escort -- and, in addition, that he might have discerned some 
"impropriety" in a sexual relationship with a White House intern.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_165_"><SUP>(165)</SUP></A> 
<P>White House records corroborate details of Ms. Lewinsky's account. She 
testified that her November 15 encounters with the President occurred at about 8 
p.m. and 10 p.m., and that in each case the two of them went from the Chief of 
Staff's office to the Oval Office area.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_166_"><SUP>(166)</SUP></A> 
Records show that the President visited the Chief of Staff's office for one 
minute at 8:12 p.m. and for two minutes at 9:23 p.m., in each case returning to 
the Oval Office.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_167_"><SUP>(167)</SUP></A> 
She recalled that the President took a telephone call during their sexual 
encounter, and she believed that the caller was a Member of Congress or a 
Senator.<A

White House records show that after returning to the Oval Office from the Chief 
of Staff's office, the President talked to two Members of Congress: Rep. Jim 
Chapman from 9:25 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., and Rep. John Tanner from 9:31 p.m. to 9:35

<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had a second sexual 
encounter two days later (still during the government furlough), on Friday, 
November 17. She was at the White House until 8:56 p.m., then returned from 9:38 
to 10:39 p.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_170_"><SUP>(170)</SUP></A> At 
9:45 p.m., a few minutes after Ms. Lewinsky's reentry, the President went from 
the Oval Office to the Chief of Staff's office (where Ms. Lewinsky worked during 
the furlough) for one minute, then returned to the Oval Office for 30 minutes. 
From there, he went back to the Chief of Staff's office until 10:34 p.m. 
(approximately when Ms. Lewinsky left the White House), then went by the Oval 
Office and the Ground Floor before retiring to the Residence at 10:40 p.m.<A

<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified: 
<P>We were again working late because it was during the furlough and Jennifer 
Palmieri . . . had ordered pizza along with Ms. Currie and Ms. Hernreich. And 
when the pizza came, I went down to let them know that the pizza was there and 
it was at that point when I walked into Ms. Currie's office that the President 
was standing there with some other people discussing something. <BR wp="br1"><BR 
wp="br2">
<P>And they all came back to the office and Mr. -- I think it was Mr. Toiv, 
somebody accidentally knocked pizza on my jacket, so I went to go use the 
restroom to wash it off and as I was coming out of the restroom, the President 
was standing in Ms. Currie's doorway and said, "You can come out this way."<A

<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky and the President went into the area of the private study, 
according to Ms. Lewinsky. There, either in the hallway or the bathroom, she and 
the President kissed. After a few minutes, in Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she 
told him that she needed to get back to her desk. The President suggested that 
she bring him some slices of pizza.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_173_"><SUP>(173)</SUP></A> 
<P>A few minutes later, she returned to the Oval Office area with pizza and told 
Ms. Currie that the President had requested it. Ms. Lewinsky testified: "[Ms. 
Currie] opened the door and said, 'Sir, the girl's here with the pizza.' He told 
me to come in. Ms. Currie went back into her office and then we went into the 
back study area again."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_174_"><SUP>(174)</SUP></A> 
Several witnesses confirm that when Ms. Lewinsky delivered pizza to the 
President that night, the two of them were briefly alone.<A

<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and the President had a sexual encounter 
during this visit.<A

They kissed, and the President touched Ms. Lewinsky's bare breasts with his 
hands and mouth.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_177_"><SUP>(177)</SUP></A> At 
some point, Ms. Currie approached the door leading to the hallway, which was 
ajar, and said that the President had a telephone call.<A

Ms. Lewinsky recalled that the caller was a Member of Congress with a 
nickname.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_179_"><SUP>(179)</SUP></A> 
While the President was on the telephone, according to Ms. Lewinsky, "he 
unzipped his pants and exposed himself," and she performed oral sex.<A

Again, he stopped her before he ejaculated.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_181_"><SUP>(181)</SUP></A> 
<P>During this visit, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President told her that he 
liked her smile and her energy. He also said: "I'm usually around on weekends, 
no one else is around, and you can come and see me."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_182_"><SUP>(182)</SUP></A> 
<P>Records corroborate Ms. Lewinsky's recollection that the President took a 
call from a Member of Congress with a nickname. While Ms. Lewinsky was at the 
White House that evening (9:38 to 10:39 p.m.), the President had one telephone 
conversation with a Member of Congress: From 9:53 to 10:14 p.m., he spoke with 
Rep. H.L. "Sonny" Callahan.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_183_"><SUP>(183)</SUP></A> 
<P>In his <U>Jones</U> deposition on January 17, 1998, President Clinton -- who 
said he was unable to recall most of his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky -- did 
remember her "back there with a pizza" during the government shutdown. He said, 
however, that he did not believe that the two of them were alone.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_184_"><SUP>(184)</SUP></A> 
Testifying before the grand jury on August 17, 1998, the President said that his 
first "real conversation" with Ms. Lewinsky occurred during the November 1995 
furlough. He testified: "One night she brought me some pizza. We had some 
remarks."<A

<P><A name=L30><STRONG>E. December 31 Sexual Encounter</STRONG> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had their third sexual

<P>-- was at the White House on Sunday, December 31, 1995, until 1:16 p.m.; her 
time of arrival is not shown.<A

<P>Sometime between noon and 1 p.m., in Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she was in 
the pantry area of the President's private dining room talking with a White 
House steward, Bayani Nelvis. She told Mr. Nelvis that she had recently smoked 
her first cigar, and he offered to give her one of the President's cigars. Just 
then, the President came down the hallway from the Oval Office and saw Ms. 
Lewinsky. The President dispatched Mr. Nelvis to deliver something to Mr. 
Panetta.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_188_"><SUP>(188)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she told the President that Mr. Nelvis had 
promised her a cigar, and the President gave her one.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_189_"><SUP>(189)</SUP></A> 
She told him her name -- she had the impression that he had forgotten it in the 
six weeks since their furlough encounters because, when passing her in the 
hallway, he had called her "Kiddo."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_190_"><SUP>(190)</SUP></A> 
The President replied that he knew her name; in fact, he added, having lost the 
phone number she had given him, he had tried to find her in the phonebook.<A

<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, they moved to the study. "And then . . . we were 
kissing and he lifted my sweater and exposed my breasts and was fondling them 
with his hands and with his mouth."<A

She performed oral sex.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_193_"><SUP>(193)</SUP></A>

"he didn't know me well enough or he didn't trust me yet."<A

never indicated that anything sexual occurred then or at any other point in 
1995.<A

<P>President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had additional sexual encounters near the 
Oval Office in 1996. After their sixth sexual encounter, the President and Ms.

the President terminated their sexual relationship, then revived it on March 31. 

<P><A name=L33><STRONG>A. January 7 Sexual Encounter </STRONG>
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had another sexual encounter 
on Sunday, January 7, 1996. Although White House records do not indicate that 
Ms. Lewinsky was at the White House that day, her testimony and other evidence 
indicate that she was there.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_201_"><SUP>(201)</SUP></A> 
The President, according to White House records, was in the Oval Office most of 
the afternoon, from 2:13 to 5:49 p.m.<A

<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her early that afternoon. 
It was the first time he had called her at home.<A

her recollection: "I asked him what he was doing and he said he was going to be 
going into the office soon. I said, oh, do you want some company? And he said, 
oh, that would be great."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_204_"><SUP>(204)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky went to her office, and the President called to arrange their 
rendezvous: 
<P>[W]e made an arrangement that . . . he would have the door to his office 
open, and I would pass by the office with some papers and then . . . he would 
sort of stop me and invite me in. So, that was exactly what happened. I passed 
by and that was actually when I saw [Secret Service Uniformed Officer] Lew Fox 
who was on duty outside the Oval Office, and stopped and spoke with Lew for a 
few minutes, and then the President came out and said, oh, hey, Monica . . . 
come on in . . . . And so we spoke for about 10 minutes in the [Oval] office. We 
sat on the sofas. Then we went into the back study and we were intimate in the 
bathroom.<A

<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">

The President "was talking about performing oral sex on me," according to Ms.

But she stopped him because she was menstruating and he did not.<A

Ms. Lewinsky did perform oral sex on him.<A

<P>Afterward, she and the President moved to the Oval Office and talked. 
According to Ms. Lewinsky: "[H]e was chewing on a cigar. And then he had the 
cigar in his hand and he was kind of looking at the cigar in . . . sort of a 
naughty way. And so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I looked at the cigar and I looked at him 
and I said, we can do that, too, some time."<A

<P>Corroborating aspects of Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, records show that 
Officer Fox was posted outside the Oval Office the afternoon of January 7.<A

Officer Fox (who is now retired) testified that he recalled an incident with Ms. 
Lewinsky one weekend afternoon when he was on duty by the Oval Office:<A

<P>[T]he President of the United States came out, and he asked me, he says, 
"Have you seen any young congressional staff members here today?" I said, "No, 
sir." He said, "Well, I'm expecting one." He says, "Would you please let me know 
when they show up?" And I said, "Yes, sir."<A

Affairs Office, where Ms. Lewinsky worked.<A

<P>We had . . . had phone sex for the first time the week prior, and I was 
feeling a little bit insecure about whether he had liked it or didn't like it . 
. . . I didn't know if this was sort of developing into some kind of a 
longer-term relationship than what I thought it initially might have been, that 
maybe he had some regular girlfriend who was furloughed . . . .<A

this just about sex . . . or do you have some interest in trying to get to know 
me as a person?"<A

holiday while Ms. Lewinsky worked at the White House (most likely in the early 
spring of 1996), Ms. Lewinsky appeared in the area of the Oval Office carrying a 
folder and said, "I have these papers for the President."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_249_"><SUP>(249)</SUP></A> 
After knocking, Agent Garabito opened the Oval Office door, told the President 
he had a visitor, ushered Ms. Lewinsky in, and closed the door behind her.<A

When Agent Garabito's shift ended a few minutes later, Ms. Lewinsky was still in 
the Oval Office.<A

<P>Second, concerning Ms. Lewinsky's recollection of a call from a sugar grower 
named "Fanuli," the President talked with Alfonso Fanjul of Palm Beach, Florida, 
from 12:42 to 1:04 p.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_252_"><SUP>(252)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Fanjul had telephoned a few minutes earlier, at 12:24 p.m.<A

The Fanjuls are prominent sugar growers in Florida.<A

<P><A name=L37><STRONG>E. Continuing Contacts </STRONG>
<P>After the break-up on February 19, 1996, according to Ms. Lewinsky, "there 
continued to sort of be this flirtation . . . when we'd see each other."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_255_"><SUP>(255)</SUP></A> 
After passing Ms. Lewinsky in a hallway one night in late February or March, the 
President telephoned her at home and said he was disappointed that, because she 
had already left the White House for the evening, they could not get together. 
Ms. Lewinsky testified that the call "sort of implied to me that he was 
interested in starting up again."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_256_"><SUP>(256)</SUP></A> On 
March 10, 1996, Ms. Lewinsky took a visiting friend, Natalie Ungvari, to the 
White House. They bumped into the President, who said to Ms. Ungvari when Ms. 
Lewinsky introduced them: "You must be her friend from California."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_257_"><SUP>(257)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Ungvari was "shocked" that the President knew where she was from.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_258_"><SUP>(258)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that on Friday, March 29, 1996, she was walking down a 
hallway when she passed the President, who was wearing the first necktie she had 
given him. She asked where he had gotten the tie, and he replied: "Some girl 
with style gave it to me."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_259_"><SUP>(259)</SUP></A> 
Later, he telephoned her at her desk and asked if she would like to see a movie. 
His plan was that she would position herself in the hallway by the White House 
Theater at a certain time, and he would invite her to join him and a group of 
guests as they entered. Ms. Lewinsky responded that she did not want people to 
think she was lurking around the West Wing uninvited.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_260_"><SUP>(260)</SUP></A> 
She asked if they could arrange a rendezvous over the weekend instead, and he 
said he would try.<A

Records confirm that the President spent the evening of March 29 in the White 
House Theater.<A

resumed their sexual contact.<A

The President was in the Oval Office from 3:00 to 5:46 p.m.<A

suggested that she come to the Oval Office on the pretext of delivering papers 
to him.<A

She went to the Oval Office and was admitted by a plainclothes Secret Service 
agent.<A

her folder was a gift for the President, a Hugo Boss necktie.<A

<P>In the hallway by the study, the President and Ms. Lewinsky kissed. On this 
occasion, according to Ms. Lewinsky, "he focused on me pretty exclusively," 
kissing her bare breasts and fondling her genitals.<A

one point, the President inserted a cigar into Ms. Lewinsky's vagina, then put 
the cigar in his mouth and said: "It tastes good."<A

<CENTER><A name=L39><STRONG>IV. April 1996: Ms. Lewinsky's Transfer to the 
Pentagon</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>With White House and Secret Service employees remarking on Ms. Lewinsky's 
frequent presence in the West Wing, a deputy chief of staff ordered Ms. Lewinsky 
transferred from the White House to the Pentagon. On April 7 -- Easter Sunday -- 
Ms. Lewinsky told the President of her dismissal. He promised to bring her back 
after the election, and they had a sexual encounter. 
<P><A name=L40><STRONG>A. Earlier Observations of Ms. Lewinsky in the West 
Wing</STRONG> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky's visits to the Oval Office area had not gone unnoticed. Officer 
Fox testified that "it was pretty commonly known that she did frequent the West 
Wing on the weekends."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_275_"><SUP>(275)</SUP></A> 
Another Secret Service uniformed officer, William Ludtke III, once saw her exit 
from the pantry near the Oval Office; she seemed startled and possibly 
embarrassed to be spotted.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_276_"><SUP>(276)</SUP></A> 
Officer John Muskett testified that "if the President was known to be coming 
into the Diplomatic Reception Room, a lot of times [Ms. Lewinsky] just happened 
to be walking down the corridor, you know, maybe just to see the President."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_277_"><SUP>(277)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged that she tried to position herself to see the 
President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_278_"><SUP>(278)</SUP></A> 
<P>Although they could not date them precisely, Secret Service officers and 
agents testified about several occasions when Ms. Lewinsky and the President 
were alone in the Oval Office. William C. Bordley, a former member of the 
Presidential Protective Detail, testified that in late 1995 or early 1996, he 
stopped Ms. Lewinsky outside the Oval Office because she did not have her 
pass.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_279_"><SUP>(279)</SUP></A> 
The President opened the Oval Office door, indicated to Agent Bordley that Ms. 
Lewinsky's presence was all right, and ushered Ms. Lewinsky into the Oval 
Office.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_280_"><SUP>(280)</SUP></A> 
Agent Bordley saw Ms. Lewinsky leave about half an hour later.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_281_"><SUP>(281)</SUP></A> 
<P>Another former member of the Presidential Protective Detail, Robert C. 
Ferguson, testified that one Saturday in winter, the President told him that he 
was expecting "some staffers."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_282_"><SUP>(282)</SUP></A> A 
short time later, Ms. Lewinsky arrived and said that "[t]he President needs 
me."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_283_"><SUP>(283)</SUP></A> 
Agent Ferguson announced Ms. Lewinsky and admitted her to the Oval Office.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_284_"><SUP>(284)</SUP></A> 
About 10 or 15 minutes later, Agent Ferguson rotated to a post on the Colonnade 
outside the Oval Office.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_285_"><SUP>(285)</SUP></A> He 
glanced through the window into the Oval Office and saw the President and Ms. 
Lewinsky go through the door leading toward the private study.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_286_"><SUP>(286)</SUP></A> 
<P>Deeming her frequent visits to the Oval Office area a "nuisance," one Secret 
Service Officer complained to Evelyn Lieberman, the Deputy Chief of Staff for 
Operations.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_287_"><SUP>(287)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lieberman was already aware of Ms. Lewinsky. In December 1995, according to 
Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Lieberman chided her for being in the West Wing and told her 
that interns are not permitted around the Oval Office. Ms. Lewinsky (who had 
begun her Office of Legislative Affairs job) told Ms. Lieberman that she was not 
an intern anymore. After expressing surprise that Ms. Lewinsky had been hired, 
Ms. Lieberman said she must have Ms. Lewinsky confused with someone else.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_288_"><SUP>(288)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lieberman confirmed that she reprimanded Ms. Lewinsky, whom she considered 
"what we used to call a 'clutch' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. always someplace she shouldn't 
be."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_289_"><SUP>(289)</SUP></A> 
<P>In Ms. Lewinsky's view, some White House staff members seemed to think that 
she was to blame for the President's evident interest in her: 
<P>[P]eople were wary of his weaknesses, maybe, and . . . they didn't want to 
look at him and think that he could be responsible for anything, so it had to 
all be my fault . . . I was stalking him or I was making advances towards him.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_290_"><SUP>(290)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L41><STRONG>B. Decision to Transfer Ms. Lewinsky </STRONG>
<P>Ms. Lieberman testified that, because Ms. Lewinsky was so persistent in her 
efforts to be near the President, "I decided to get rid of her."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_291_"><SUP>(291)</SUP></A> 
First she consulted Chief of Staff Panetta. According to Mr. Panetta, Ms. 
Lieberman told him about a woman on the staff who was "spending too much time 
around the West Wing." Because of "the appearance that it was creating," Ms. 
Lieberman proposed to move her out of the White House. Mr. Panetta -- who 
testified that he valued Ms. Lieberman's role as "a tough disciplinarian" and 
"trusted her judgment" -- replied, "Fine."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_292_"><SUP>(292)</SUP></A> 
Although Ms. Lieberman said she could not recall having heard any rumors linking 
the President and Ms. Lewinsky, she acknowledged that "the President was 
vulnerable to these kind of rumors . . . yes, yes, that was one of the reasons" 
for moving Ms. Lewinsky out of the White House.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_293_"><SUP>(293)</SUP></A> 
Later, in September 1997, Marcia Lewis (Ms. Lewinsky's mother) complained about 
her daughter's dismissal to Ms. Lieberman, whom she met at a Voice of America 
ceremony. Ms. Lieberman, according to Ms. Lewis, responded by "saying something 
about Monica being cursed because she's beautiful." Ms. Lewis gathered from the 
remark that Ms. Lieberman, as part of her effort to protect the President, 
"would want to have pretty women moved out."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_294_"><SUP>(294)</SUP></A> 
<P>Most people understood that the principal reason for Ms. Lewinsky's transfer 
was her habit of hanging around the Oval Office and the West Wing.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_295_"><SUP>(295)</SUP></A> In 
a memo in October 1996, John Hilley, Assistant to the President and Director of 
Legislative Affairs, reported that Ms. Lewinsky had been "got[ten] rid of" in 
part "because of 'extracurricular activities'" (a phrase, he maintained in the 
grand jury, that meant only that Ms. Lewinsky was often absent from her work 
station).<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_296_"><SUP>(296)</SUP></A> 
<P>White House officials arranged for Ms. Lewinsky to get another job in the 
Administration.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_297_"><SUP>(297)</SUP></A> 
"Our direction is to make sure she has a job in an Agency," Patsy Thomasson 
wrote in an email message on April 9, 1996.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_298_"><SUP>(298)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Thomasson's office (Presidential Personnel) sent Ms. Lewinsky's resume to 
Charles Duncan, Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense and White House 
Liaison, and asked him to find a Pentagon opening for her.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_299_"><SUP>(299)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Duncan was told that, though Ms. Lewinsky had performed her duties capably, 
she was being dismissed for hanging around the Oval Office too much.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_300_"><SUP>(300)</SUP></A> 
According to Mr. Duncan -- who had received as many as 40 job referrals per day 
from the White House -- the White House had never given such an explanation for 
a transfer.<A

<P><A name=L42><STRONG>C. Ms. Lewinsky's Notification of Her Transfer</STRONG> 
<P>On Friday, April 5, 1996, Timothy Keating, Staff Director for Legislative 
Affairs, informed Ms. Lewinsky that she would have to leave her White House 
job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_302_"><SUP>(302)</SUP></A> 
According to Mr. Keating, he told her that she was not being fired, merely 
"being given a different opportunity." In fact, she could tell people it was a 
promotion if she cared to do so.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_303_"><SUP>(303)</SUP></A> 
Upon hearing of her dismissal, Ms. Lewinsky burst into tears and asked if there 
was any way for her to stay in the White House, even without pay.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_304_"><SUP>(304)</SUP></A> 
No, Mr. Keating said. According to Ms. Lewinsky, "He told me I was too sexy to 
be working in the East Wing and that this job at the Pentagon where I'd be 
writing press releases was a sexier job."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_305_"><SUP>(305)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky was devastated. She felt that she was being transferred simply 
because of her relationship with the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_306_"><SUP>(306)</SUP></A> 
And she feared that with the loss of her White House job, "I was never going to

at 4:56 and left at 5:28 p.m.<A

<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at home that day. 
After they spoke of the death of the Commerce Secretary the previous week, she 
told him of her dismissal: 
<P>I had asked him . . . if he was doing okay with Ron Brown's death, and then 
after we talked about that for a little bit I told him that my last day was 
Monday. And . . . he seemed really upset and sort of asked me to tell him what 
had happened. So I did and I was crying and I asked him if I could come see him, 
and he said that that was fine.<A

Officer Muskett admitted her to the Oval Office, and she and the President 
proceeded to the private study.<A

<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President seemed troubled about her upcoming 
departure from the White House: 
<P>He told me that he thought that my being transferred had something to do with 
him and that he was upset. He said, "Why do they have to take you away from me? 
I trust you." And then he told me -- he looked at me and he said, "I promise you 
if I win in November I'll bring you back like that."<A

<P>He also indicated that she could have any job she wanted after the

<P>When asked if he had promised to get Ms. Lewinsky another White House job, 
the President told the grand jury: 
<P>What I told Ms. Lewinsky was that . . . I would do what I could to see, if 
she had a good record at the Pentagon, and she assured me she was doing a good 
job and working hard, that I would do my best to see that the fact that she had 
been sent away from the Legislative Affairs section did not keep her from 
getting a job in the White House, and that is, in fact, what I tried to do. . . 
. But I did not tell her I would order someone to hire her, and I never did, and 
I wouldn't do that. It wouldn't be right.<A

<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">

Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex. The President did not ejaculate in her

Ms. Lewinsky testified: 
<P>Harold Ickes has a very distinct voice and . . . I heard him holler "Mr. 
President," and the President looked at me and I looked at him and he jetted out 
into the Oval Office and I panicked and . . . thought that maybe because Harold 
was so close with the President that they might just wander back there and the 
President would assume that I knew to leave.<A

Muskett was posted near the door to the Oval Office on Easter Sunday.<A

<P>About 20 to 25 minutes later, according to Officer Muskett, the telephone 
outside the Oval Office rang. The White House operator said that the President 
had an important call but he was not picking up.<A

The agent working alongside Officer Muskett knocked on the door to the Oval

was empty, and the door leading to the study was slightly ajar.<A

(Ms. Lewinsky testified that the President left the door ajar during their 
sexual encounters.<A

The agent called out, "Mr. President?" There was no response. The agent stepped 
into the Oval Office and called out more loudly, "Mr. President?" This time 
there was a response from the study area, according to Officer Muskett: "Huh?" 
The agent called out that the President had a phone call, and the President said 
he would take it.<A

Less than a minute after Mr. Ickes entered Ms. Currie's reception area,

Ms. Lewinsky, the President said he had checked on the reason for her transfer:

very upset about it. He said, "Do you know anything about this?" I said, "Yes." 
He said, "Who fired her?" I said, "I did." And he said, "Oh, okay."<A

<P>Three other witnesses confirm that the President knew why Ms. Lewinsky was 
transferred to the Pentagon. In 1997, the President told Chief of Staff Erskine 
Bowles "that there was a young woman -- her name was Monica Lewinsky -- who used 
to work at the White House; that Evelyn . . . thought she hung around the Oval 
Office too much and transferred her to the Pentagon."<A

According to Betty Currie, the President believed that Ms. Lewinsky had been 
unfairly transferred.<A

The President's close friend, Vernon Jordan, testified that the President said 
to him in December 1997 that "he knew about [Ms. Lewinsky's] situation, which

<P>After Ms. Lewinsky began her Pentagon job on April 16, 1996, she had no 
further physical contact with the President for the remainder of the year. She 
and the President spoke by phone (and had phone sex) but saw each other only at 
public functions. Ms. Lewinsky grew frustrated after the election because the 
President did not bring her back to work at the White House.

<P><A name=L49><STRONG>C. Telephone Conversations</STRONG> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky and the President did talk by telephone, especially in her first 
weeks at the new job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_351_"><SUP>(351)</SUP></A> By 
Ms. Lewinsky's estimate, the President phoned her (sometimes leaving a message) 
four or five times in the month after she started working at the Pentagon, then 
two or three times a month thereafter for the rest of 1996.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_352_"><SUP>(352)</SUP></A> 
During the fall 1996 campaign, the President sometimes called from trips when 
Mrs. Clinton was not accompanying him.<A

During at least seven of the 1996 calls, Ms. Lewinsky and the President had 
phone sex.<A

<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at about 6:30 a.m. on 
July 19, the day he was leaving for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and they had 
phone sex, after which the President exclaimed, "[G]ood morning!" and then said: 
"What a way to start a day."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_355_"><SUP>(355)</SUP></A> A 
call log shows that the President called the White House operator at 12:11 a.m. 
on July 19 and asked for a wake-up call at 7 a.m., then at 6:40 a.m., the 
President called and said he was already up.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_356_"><SUP>(356)</SUP></A> In 
Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she and the President also had phone sex on May 21, 
July 5 or 6, October 22, and December 2, 1996.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_357_"><SUP>(357)</SUP></A> On 
those dates, Mrs. Clinton was in Denver (May 21), Prague and Budapest (July 
5-6), Las Vegas (October 22), and en route to Bolivia (December 2).<A

<P>Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly told the President that she disliked her Pentagon job 
and wanted to return to the White House.<A

a recorded conversation, Ms. Lewinsky recounted one call: 
<P>[A] month had passed and -- so he had called one night, and I said, "Well," I 
said, "I'm really unhappy," you know. And [the President] said, "I don't want to 
talk about your job tonight. I'll call you this week, and then we'll talk about 
it. I want to talk about other things" -- which meant phone sex.<A

<P>She expected to talk with him the following weekend, and she was "ready to 
broach the idea of . . . going to the campaign," but he did not call.<A

<P>Ms. Lewinsky and the President also talked about their relationship. During a 
phone conversation on September 5, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she told the 
President that she wanted to have intercourse with him. He responded that he 
could not do so because of the possible consequences. The two of them argued, 
and he asked if he should stop calling her. No, she responded.<A

<P><A name=L50><STRONG>D. Public Encounters</STRONG> 
<P>During this period, Ms. Lewinsky occasionally saw the President in public. 
She testified: 
<P>I'm an insecure person . . . and I was insecure about the relationship at 
times and thought that he would come to forget me easily and if I hadn't heard 
from him . . . it was very difficult for me . . . . [U]sually when I'd see him, 
it would kind of prompt him to call me. So I made an effort. I would go early 
and stand in the front so I could see him . . . .<A

Saxophone Club, a political organization.<A

June 14, Ms. Lewinsky and her family attended the taping of the President's 
weekly radio address and had photos taken with the President.<A

August 18, Ms. Lewinsky attended the President's 50th birthday party at Radio 
City Music Hall, and she got into a cocktail party for major donors where she 
saw the President.<A

According to Ms. Lewinsky, when the President reached past her at the rope line 
to shake hands with another guest, she reached out and touched his crotch in a 
"playful" fashion.<A

October 23, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she talked with the President at a 
fundraiser for Senate Democrats.<A

The two were photographed together at the event.<A

Lewinsky, and she said to him, "Hey, Handsome -- I like your tie."<A

The President telephoned her that night. She said she planned to be at the White 
House on Pentagon business the next day, and he told her to stop by the Oval 
Office. At the White House the next day, Ms. Lewinsky did not see the President 
because Ms. Lieberman was nearby.<A

her a job immediately after the election. "I kept a calendar with a countdown 
until election day," she later wrote in an unsent letter to him. The letter 
states: 
<P>I was so sure that the weekend after the election you would call me to come 
visit and you would kiss me passionately and tell me you couldn't wait to have 
me back. You'd ask me where I wanted to work and say something akin to "Consider 
it done" and it would be. Instead I didn't hear from you for weeks and 
subsequently your phone calls became less frequent.<A

<CENTER>VI. Early 1997: Resumption of Sexual Encounters</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>In 1997, President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had further private meetings, 
which now were arranged by Betty Currie, the President's secretary. After the 
taping of the President's weekly radio address on February 28, the President and 
Ms. Lewinsky had a sexual encounter. On March 24, they had what proved to be 
their final sexual encounter. Throughout this period, Ms. Lewinsky continued to 
press for a job at the White House, to no avail.

<P><A name=L54><STRONG>1. Role of Betty Currie</STRONG> 
<P><A name=L55><STRONG>a. Arranging Meetings</STRONG> 
<P>In 1997, with the presidential election past, Ms. Lewinsky and the President 
resumed their one-on-one meetings and sexual encounters. The President's 
secretary, Betty Currie, acted as intermediary. 
<P>According to Ms. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky would often call her and say she wanted 
to see the President, sometimes to discuss a particular topic.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_378_"><SUP>(378)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie would ask President Clinton, and, if he agreed, arrange the 
meeting.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_379_"><SUP>(379)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie also said it was "not unusual" that Ms. Lewinsky would talk by phone 
with the President and then call Ms. Currie to set up a meeting.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_380_"><SUP>(380)</SUP></A> At 
times, Ms. Currie placed calls to Ms. Lewinsky for President Clinton and put him 
on the line.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_381_"><SUP>(381)</SUP></A> 
<P>The meetings between the President and Ms. Lewinsky often occurred on 
weekends.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_382_"><SUP>(382)</SUP></A> 
When Ms. Lewinsky would arrive at the White House, Ms. Currie generally would be 
the one to authorize her entry and take her to the West Wing.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_383_"><SUP>(383)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie acknowledged that she sometimes would come to the White House for the 
sole purpose of having Ms. Lewinsky admitted and bringing her to see the 
President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_384_"><SUP>(384)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky and the President were alone together in 
the Oval Office or the study for 15 to 20 minutes on multiple occasions.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_385_"><SUP>(385)</SUP></A> 
<P>Secret Service officers and agents took note of Ms. Currie's role. Officer 
Steven Pape once observed Ms. Currie come to the White House for the duration of 
Ms. Lewinsky's visit, then leave.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_386_"><SUP>(386)</SUP></A> 
When calling to alert the officer at the West Wing lobby that Ms. Lewinsky was 
en route, Ms. Currie would sometimes say, "[Y]ou know who it is."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_387_"><SUP>(387)</SUP></A> On 
one occasion, Ms. Currie instructed Officer Brent Chinery to hold Ms. Lewinsky 
at the lobby for a few minutes because she needed to move the President to the 
study.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_388_"><SUP>(388)</SUP></A> On 
another occasion, Ms. Currie told Officer Chinery to have Ms. Lewinsky held at 
the gate for 30 to 40 minutes because the President already had a visitor.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_389_"><SUP>(389)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that she once asked the President why Ms. Currie had 
to clear her in, and why he could not do so himself. "[H]e said because if 
someone comes to see him, there's a list circulated among the staff members and 
then everyone would be questioning why I was there to see him."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_390_"><SUP>(390)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L56><STRONG>b. Intermediary for Gifts</STRONG> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky also sent over a number of packages -- six or eight, Ms. Currie 
estimated.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_391_"><SUP>(391)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms. Currie, Ms. Lewinsky would call and say she was sending 
something for the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_392_"><SUP>(392)</SUP></A> 
The package would arrive addressed to Ms. Currie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_393_"><SUP>(393)</SUP></A> 
Courier receipts show that Ms. Lewinsky sent seven packages to the White House 
between October 7 and December 8, 1997.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_394_"><SUP>(394)</SUP></A> 
Evidence indicates that Ms. Lewinsky on occasion also dropped parcels off with 
Ms. Currie or had a family member do so,<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_395_"><SUP>(395)</SUP></A> 
and brought gifts to the President when visiting him.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_396_"><SUP>(396)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie testified that most packages from Ms. Lewinsky were intended for the 
President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_397_"><SUP>(397)</SUP></A> 
<P>Although Ms. Currie generally opened letters and parcels to the President, 
she did not open these packages from Ms. Lewinsky.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_398_"><SUP>(398)</SUP></A> 
She testified that "I made the determination not to open" such letters and 
packages because "I felt [they were] probably personal."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_399_"><SUP>(399)</SUP></A> 
Instead, she would leave the package in the President's box, and "[h]e would 
pick it up."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_400_"><SUP>(400)</SUP></A> To 
the best of her knowledge, such parcels always reached the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_401_"><SUP>(401)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L57><STRONG>c. Secrecy </STRONG>
<P>Ms. Currie testified that she suspected impropriety in the President's 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_402_"><SUP>(402)</SUP></A> 
She told the grand jury that she "had concern." In her words: "[H]e was spending 
a lot of time with a 24-year-old young lady. I know he has said that young 
people keep him involved in what's happening in the world, so I knew that was 
one reason, but there was a concern of mine that she was spending more time than 
most."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_403_"><SUP>(403)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie understood that "the majority" of the President's meetings with Ms. 
Lewinsky were "more personal in nature as opposed to business."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_404_"><SUP>(404)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Currie also testified that she tried to avoid learning details of the 
relationship between the President and Ms. Lewinsky. On one occasion, Ms. 
Lewinsky said of herself and the President, "As long as no one saw us -- and no 
one did -- then nothing happened." Ms. Currie responded: "Don't want to hear it. 
Don't say any more. I don't want to hear any more."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_405_"><SUP>(405)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Currie helped keep the relationship secret. When the President wanted to 
talk with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie would dial the call herself rather than go 
through White House operators, who keep logs of presidential calls made through 
the switchboard.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_406_"><SUP>(406)</SUP></A> 
When Ms. Lewinsky phoned and Ms. Currie put the President on the line, she did 
not log the call, though the standard procedure was to note all calls, personal 
and professional.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_407_"><SUP>(407)</SUP></A> 
According to Secret Service uniformed officers, Ms. Currie sometimes tried to 
persuade them to admit Ms. Lewinsky to the White House compound without making a 
record of it.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_408_"><SUP>(408)</SUP></A> 
<P>In addition, Ms. Currie avoided writing down or retaining most messages from 
Ms. Lewinsky to the President. In response to a grand jury subpoena, the White 
House turned over only one note to the President concerning Ms. Lewinsky -- 
whereas evidence indicates that Ms. Lewinsky used Ms. Currie to convey requests 
and messages to the President on many occasions.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_409_"><SUP>(409)</SUP></A> 
<P>When bringing Ms. Lewinsky in from the White House gate, Ms. Currie said she 
sometimes chose a path that would reduce the likelihood of being seen by two 
White House employees who disapproved of Ms. Lewinsky: Stephen Goodin and Nancy 
Hernreich.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_410_"><SUP>(410)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie testified that she once brought Ms. Lewinsky directly to the study, 
"sneaking her back" via a roundabout path to avoid running into Mr. Goodin.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_411_"><SUP>(411)</SUP></A> 
When Ms. Lewinsky visited the White House on weekends and at night, being 
spotted was not a problem -- in Ms. Currie's words, "there would be no need to 
sneak" -- so Ms. Lewinsky would await the President in Ms. Currie's office.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_412_"><SUP>(412)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she once expressed concern about records showing 
the President's calls to her, and Ms. Currie told her not to worry.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_413_"><SUP>(413)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky also suspected that Ms. Currie was not logging in all of her gifts 
to the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_414_"><SUP>(414)</SUP></A> In 
Ms. Lewinsky's evaluation, many White House staff members tried to regulate the 
President's behavior, but Ms. Currie generally did as he wished.<A

<P><A name=L58><STRONG>2. Observations by Secret Service Officers</STRONG> 
<P>Officers of the Secret Service Uniformed Division noted Ms. Lewinsky's 1997 
visits to the White House. From radio traffic about the President's movements, 
several officers observed that the President often would head for the Oval 
Office within minutes of Ms. Lewinsky's entry to the complex, especially on 
weekends, and some noted that he would return to the Residence a short time 
after her departure.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_416_"><SUP>(416)</SUP></A> 
"It was just like clockwork," according to one officer.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_417_"><SUP>(417)</SUP></A> 
Concerned about the President's reputation, another officer suggested putting 
Ms. Lewinsky on a list of people who were not to be admitted to the White House. 
A commander responded that it was none of their business whom the President 
chose to see, and, in any event, nobody would ever find out about Ms. 
Lewinsky.<A

Once they had passed from the Oval Office toward the private study, Ms. Currie 
said, "I'll be right back," and walked on to the back pantry or the dining room,

given me . . . it's beautiful and it meant a lot to me."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_437_"><SUP>(437)</SUP></A> 
During this visit, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said he had seen her 
Valentine's Day message in the <U>Washington Post</U>, and he talked about his 
fondness for "Romeo and Juliet."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_438_"><SUP>(438)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that after the President gave her the gifts, they had 
a sexual encounter: 
<P>[W]e went back over by the bathroom in the hallway, and we kissed. We were 
kissing and he unbuttoned my dress and fondled my breasts with my bra on, and 
then took them out of my bra and was kissing them and touching them with his 
hands and with his mouth. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>And then I think I was touching him in his genital area through his pants, 
and I think I unbuttoned his shirt and was kissing his chest. And then . . . I 
wanted to perform oral sex on him . . . and so I did. And then . . . I think he 
heard something, or he heard someone in the office. So, we moved into the 
bathroom. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>And I continued to perform oral sex and then he pushed me away, kind of as he 
always did before he came, and then I stood up and I said . . . I care about you 
so much; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don't understand why you won't let me . . . make you 
come; it's important to me; I mean, it just doesn't feel complete, it doesn't 
seem right.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_439_"><SUP>(439)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and the President hugged, and "he said he 
didn't want to get addicted to me, and he didn't want me to get addicted to 
him." They looked at each other for a moment.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_440_"><SUP>(440)</SUP></A> 
Then, saying that "I don't want to disappoint you," the President consented.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_441_"><SUP>(441)</SUP></A> 
For the first time, she performed oral sex through completion.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_442_"><SUP>(442)</SUP></A> 
<P>When Ms. Lewinsky next took the navy blue Gap dress from her closet to wear 
it, she noticed stains near one hip and on the chest.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_443_"><SUP>(443)</SUP></A> 
FBI Laboratory tests revealed that the stains are the President's semen.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_444_"><SUP>(444)</SUP></A> 
<P>In his grand jury testimony, the President -- who, because the OIC had asked 
him for a blood sample (and had represented that it had ample evidentiary 
justification for making such a request), had reason to suspect that Ms. 
Lewinsky's dress might bear traces of his semen -- indicated that he and Ms. 
Lewinsky had had sexual contact on the day of the radio address. He testified: 
<P>I was sick after it was over and I, I was pleased at that time that it had 
been nearly a year since any inappropriate contact had occurred with Ms. 
Lewinsky. I promised myself it wasn't going to happen again. The facts are 
complicated about what did happen and how it happened. But, nonetheless, I'm 
responsible for it.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_445_"><SUP>(445)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Later the President added, referring to the evening of the radio address: "I 
do believe that I was alone with her from 15 to 20 minutes. I do believe that 
things happened then which were inappropriate."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_446_"><SUP>(446)</SUP></A> He 
said of the intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky: "I never should have 
started it, and I certainly shouldn't have started it back after I resolved not 
to in 1996."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_447_"><SUP>(447)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L62><STRONG>E. March 29 Sexual Encounter</STRONG> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she had what proved to be her final sexual 
encounter with the President on Saturday, March 29, 1997. Records show that she 
was at the White House from 2:03 to 3:16 p.m., admitted by Ms. Currie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_448_"><SUP>(448)</SUP></A> 
The President was in the Oval Office during this period (he left shortly after 
Ms. Lewinsky did, at 3:24 p.m.), and he did not have any phone calls during her 
White House visit.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_449_"><SUP>(449)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie arranged the meeting after the 
President said by telephone that he had something important to tell her. At the 
White House, Ms. Currie took her to the study to await the President. He came in 
on crutches, the result of a knee injury in Florida two weeks earlier.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_450_"><SUP>(450)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, their sexual encounter began with a sudden kiss: 
"[T]his was another one of those occasions when I was babbling on about 
something, and he just kissed me, kind of to shut me up, I think."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_451_"><SUP>(451)</SUP></A> 
The President unbuttoned her blouse and touched her breasts without removing her 
bra.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_452_"><SUP>(452)</SUP></A> 
"[H]e went to go put his hand down my pants, and then I unzipped them because it 
was easier. And I didn't have any panties on. And so he manually stimulated 
me."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_453_"><SUP>(453)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms. Lewinsky, "I wanted him to touch my genitals with his 
genitals," and he did so, lightly and without penetration.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_454_"><SUP>(454)</SUP></A> 
Then Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex on him, again until he ejaculated.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_455_"><SUP>(455)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had a lengthy conversation 
that day. He told her that he suspected that a foreign embassy (he did not 
specify which one) was tapping his telephones, and he proposed cover stories. If 
ever questioned, she should say that the two of them were just friends. If 
anyone ever asked about their phone sex, she should say that they knew their 
calls were being monitored all along, and the phone sex was just a put-on.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_456_"><SUP>(456)</SUP></A> 
<P>In his grand jury testimony, the President implicitly denied this encounter. 
He acknowledged "inappropriate intimate contact" with Ms. Lewinsky "on certain 
occasions in early 1996 and once in early 1997."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_457_"><SUP>(457)</SUP></A> 
The President indicated that "the one occasion in 1997" was the radio address.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_458_"><SUP>(458)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L63><STRONG>F. Continuing Job Efforts</STRONG> 
<P>With the 1996 election past, meanwhile, Ms. Lewinsky had continued striving 
to get a job at the White House. She testified that she first broached the issue 
in a telephone call with the President in January 1997, and he said he would 
speak to Bob Nash, Director of Presidential Personnel.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_459_"><SUP>(459)</SUP></A> 
She understood that Mr. Nash was supposed to "find a position for me to come 
back to the White House."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_460_"><SUP>(460)</SUP></A> 
<P>Over the months that followed, Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly asked the President to 
get her a White House job. In her recollection, the President replied that 
various staff members were working on it, including Mr. Nash and Marsha Scott, 
Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director for Presidential 
Personnel.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_461_"><SUP>(461)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President told her: 
<P>"Bob Nash is handling it," "Marsha's going to handle it" and "We just sort of 
need to be careful." You know, and . . . he would always sort of . . . validate 
what I was feeling by telling me something that I don't necessarily know is 
true. "Oh, I'll talk to her," "I'll -- you know, I'll see blah, blah, blah," and 
it was just "I'll do," "I'll do," "I'll do." And didn't, didn't, didn't.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_462_"><SUP>(462)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky came to wonder if she was being "strung along."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_463_"><SUP>(463)</SUP></A> 
<P>Testifying before the grand jury, the President acknowledged that Ms. 
Lewinsky had complained to him about her job situation: 
<P>You know, she tried for months and months to get a job back in the White 
House, not so much in the West Wing but somewhere in the White House complex, 
including the Old Executive Office Building. . . . She very much wanted to come 
back. And she interviewed for some jobs but never got one. She was, from time to 
time, upset about it.<A

<CENTER>VII. May 1997: Termination of Sexual Relationship</CENTER></STRONG>
<P>In May 1997, amid indications that Ms. Lewinsky had been indiscreet, 
President Clinton terminated the sexual relationship. 
<P><A name=L65><STRONG>A. Questions about Ms. Lewinsky's Discretion</STRONG> 
<P>In April or May 1997, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President asked if she 
had told her mother about their intimate relationship. She responded: "No. Of 
course not."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_465_"><SUP>(465)</SUP></A> 
(In truth, she had told her mother.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_466_"><SUP>(466)</SUP></A>) 
The President indicated that Ms. Lewinsky's mother possibly had said something 
about the nature of the relationship to Walter Kaye, who had mentioned it to 
Marsha Scott, who in turn had alerted the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_467_"><SUP>(467)</SUP></A> 
<P>Corroborating Ms. Lewinsky's account, Mr. Kaye testified that he told Ms. 
Lewinsky's aunt, Debra Finerman, that he understood that "her niece was very 
aggressive," a remark that angered Ms. Finerman. Ms. Finerman told Mr. Kaye that 
the President was the true aggressor: He was telephoning Ms. Lewinsky late at 
night. Ms. Finerman, in Mr. Kaye's recollection, attributed this information to 
Marcia Lewis, Ms. Lewinsky's mother (and Ms. Finerman's sister). Mr. Kaye -- who 
had disbelieved stories he had heard from Democratic National Committee people 
about an affair between Ms. Lewinsky and the President -- testified that he was 
"shocked" to hear of the late-night phone calls.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_468_"><SUP>(468)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L66><STRONG>B. May 24: Break-up </STRONG>
<P>On Saturday, May 24, 1997, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President ended 
their intimate relationship. Ms. Lewinsky was at the White House that day from 
12:21 to 1:54 p.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_469_"><SUP>(469)</SUP></A> 
The President was in the Oval Office during most of this period, from 11:59 a.m. 
to 1:47 p.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_470_"><SUP>(470)</SUP></A> He 
did not have any telephone calls.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_471_"><SUP>(471)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she got a call from Ms. Currie at about 11 a.m. 
that day, inviting her to come to the White House at about 1 p.m. Ms. Lewinsky 
arrived wearing a straw hat with the hat pin the President had given her, and 
bringing gifts for him, including a puzzle and a Banana Republic shirt. She gave 
him the gifts in the dining room, and they moved to the area of the study.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_472_"><SUP>(472)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President explained that they had to end their 
intimate relationship.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_473_"><SUP>(473)</SUP></A> 
Earlier in his marriage, he told her, he had had hundreds of affairs; but since 
turning 40, he had made a concerted effort to be faithful.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_474_"><SUP>(474)</SUP></A> He 
said he was attracted to Ms. Lewinsky, considered her a great person, and hoped 
they would remain friends. He pointed out that he could do a great deal for her. 
The situation, he stressed, was not Ms. Lewinsky's fault.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_475_"><SUP>(475)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky, weeping, tried to persuade the President not to end the sexual 
relationship, but he was unyielding, then and subsequently.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_476_"><SUP>(476)</SUP></A> 
Although she and the President kissed and hugged thereafter, according to Ms. 
Lewinsky, the sexual relationship was over.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_477_"><SUP>(477)</SUP></A> 
<P>Three days after this meeting, on May 27, 1997, the Supreme Court unanimously 
rejected President Clinton's claim that the Constitution immunized him from 
civil lawsuits. The Court ordered the sexual harassment case <U>Jones v. 
Clinton</U> to proceed.<A

<P>
<CENTER><A name=L67><STRONG>VIII. June-October 1997: Continuing Meetings and 
Calls </STRONG></CENTER>
<P>Ms. Lewinsky tried to return to the White House staff and to revive her 
sexual relationship with the President, but she failed at both. 
<P><A name=L68><STRONG>A. Continuing Job Efforts</STRONG> 
<P>Although Ms. Lewinsky was not offered another White House job, some testimony 
indicates that the President tried to get her one. 
<P>According to Betty Currie, the President instructed her and Marsha Scott to 
help Ms. Lewinsky find a White House job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_479_"><SUP>(479)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie testified that she resisted the request, because her opinion of Ms. 
Lewinsky had shifted over time. At first, she testified, she considered Ms. 
Lewinsky "a friend" who "had been wronged" and had been "maligned improperly."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_480_"><SUP>(480)</SUP></A> 
But "[l]ater on, I considered her as a pain in the neck, more or less."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_481_"><SUP>(481)</SUP></A> 
The change of heart resulted in part from Ms. Currie's many phone calls in 1997 
from Ms. Lewinsky, who was often distraught and sometimes in tears over her 
inability to get in touch with the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_482_"><SUP>(482)</SUP></A> 
Deeming her "a little bit pushy," Ms. Currie argued against bringing Ms. 
Lewinsky back to work at the White House, but the President told her and Ms. 
Scott, in Ms. Currie's words, "to still pursue her coming back."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_483_"><SUP>(483)</SUP></A> 
Indeed, according to Ms. Currie, the President "was pushing us hard" on the 
matter.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_484_"><SUP>(484)</SUP></A> To 
the best of Ms. Currie's recollection, it was the only time the President 
instructed her to try to get someone a White House job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_485_"><SUP>(485)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President told her to talk with Ms. Scott 
about a White House job in spring 1997.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_486_"><SUP>(486)</SUP></A> On 
June 16, she met with Ms. Scott.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_487_"><SUP>(487)</SUP></A> 
The meeting did not go as Ms. Lewinsky anticipated. She later recounted in an 
email message: 
<P>There is most certainly a disconnect on what [the President] said he told her 
and how she acted. She didn't even know what my title or my job was . . . . She 
didn't have any job openings to offer. Instead, she made me go over what 
happened when I had to leave (who told me), and then proceeded to confirm the 
Evelyn [Lieberman] story about my "inappropriate behavior." Then she asked me: 
with such nasty women there and people gossiping about me, why did I want to 
come back? I was so upset. I really did not feel it was her place to question me 
about that. Later on, I said something about being told I could come back after 
November and she wanted to know who told me that! So I have placed a call to him 
but I don't know what is going to happen. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky added that she was inclined "to walk away from it all," but 
acknowledged that "I'm always saying this and then I change my mind."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_488_"><SUP>(488)</SUP></A> 
<P>Though she characterized her recollection as "all jumbled," Ms. Scott 
corroborated much of Ms. Lewinsky's account.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_489_"><SUP>(489)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Scott said that at some point she did ask Ms. Lewinsky why she wanted to 
return to the White House.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_490_"><SUP>(490)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Scott also said that she was unaware of Ms. Lewinsky's job title before 
their meeting.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_491_"><SUP>(491)</SUP></A> 
<P>Over the next three weeks, Ms. Lewinsky tried repeatedly, without success, to 
talk with the President about her job quest. In a draft of a letter to Ms. 
Currie, she wrote that the President "said to me that he had told [Ms. Scott] I 
had gotten a bum deal, and I should get a good job in the West Wing," but Ms. 
Scott did not seem eager to arrange for Ms. Lewinsky's return. Ms. Lewinsky 
wrote: 
<P>I was surprised that she would question his judgment and not just do what he 
asked of her. Is it possible that, in fact, he did not tell her that? Does he 
really not want me back in the complex? He has not responded to my note, nor has 
he called me. Do you know what is going on? If so, are you able to share it with 
me?<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_492_"><SUP>(492)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Currie testified to "a vague recollection" of having seen this letter.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_493_"><SUP>(493)</SUP></A> 
<P>On June 29, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky wrote several notes. In a draft letter to Ms. 
Scott, Ms. Lewinsky wrote that "our last conversation was very upsetting to me," 
and added: 
<P>Marsha, I was told that I could come back after the election. I knew why I 
had to leave last year by mid-April, and I have been beyond patient since then. 
I do not think it is fair to . . . be told by the person whom I was told would 
get me a job that there is nothing for me and she doesn't really hear about 
positions [in] the complex anyway. I know that in your eyes I am just a 
hindrance -- a woman who doesn't have a certain someone's best interests at 
heart, but please trust me when I say I do.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_494_"><SUP>(494)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky also drafted a note to the President pleading for a brief 
meeting the following Tuesday. Referring to her inability to get in touch with 
him, she wrote: "<U>Please do not do this to me.</U> I feel disposable, used and 
insignificant. I understand your hands are tied, but I want to talk to you and 
look at some options."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_495_"><SUP>(495)</SUP></A> 
Around this time, Ms. Lewinsky told a friend that she was considering moving to 
another city or country.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_496_"><SUP>(496)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L69><STRONG>B. July 3 Letter</STRONG> 
<P>"[V]ery frustrated" over her inability to get in touch with the President to 
discuss her job situation, Ms. Lewinsky wrote him a peevish letter on July 3, 
1997.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_497_"><SUP>(497)</SUP></A> 
Opening "Dear Sir," the letter took the President to task for breaking his 
promise to get her another White House job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_498_"><SUP>(498)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky also obliquely threatened to disclose their relationship. If she 
was not going to return to work at the White House, she wrote, then she would 
"need to explain to my parents exactly why that wasn't happening." Some 
explanation was necessary because she had told her parents that she would be 
brought back after the election.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_499_"><SUP>(499)</SUP></A> 
(Ms. Lewinsky testified that she would not actually have told her father about 
the relationship -- she had already told her mother -- but she wanted to remind 
the President that she had "left the White House like a good girl in April of 
'96," whereas other people might have threatened disclosure in order to retain 
the job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_500_"><SUP>(500)</SUP></A>) 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky also raised the possibility of a job outside Washington. If 
returning to the White House was impossible, she asked in this letter, could he 
get her a job at the United Nations in New York?<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_501_"><SUP>(501)</SUP></A> It 
was the first time that she had told the President that she was considering 
moving.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_502_"><SUP>(502)</SUP></A> 
<P>Although not questioned about this particular letter, the President testified 
that he believed Ms. Lewinsky might disclose their intimate relationship once he 
stopped it. He testified: 
<P>After I terminated the improper contact with her, she wanted to come in more 
than she did. She got angry when she didn't get in sometimes. I knew that that 
might make her more likely to speak, and I still did it because I had to limit 
the contact.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_503_"><SUP>(503)</SUP></A> 
<P>After receiving the July 3 letter, though, the President agreed to see Ms. 
Lewinsky. In her account, Ms. Currie called that afternoon and told her to come 
to the White House at 9 a.m. the next day.<A

<P><A name=L70><STRONG>C. July 4 Meeting</STRONG> 
<P>On Friday, July 4, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky had what she characterized as a "very 
emotional" visit with the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_505_"><SUP>(505)</SUP></A> 
Records show that Ms. Lewinsky entered the White House at 8:51 a.m.; no exit 
time is recorded.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_506_"><SUP>(506)</SUP></A> 
Logs indicate that the President was in the Oval Office from 8:40 until after 11 
a.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_507_"><SUP>(507)</SUP></A> 
<P>In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, their meeting began contentiously, with the 
President scolding her: "[I]t's illegal to threaten the President of the United 
States."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_508_"><SUP>(508)</SUP></A> He 
then told her that he had not read her July 3 letter beyond the "Dear Sir" line; 
he surmised that it was threatening because Ms. Currie looked upset when she 
brought it to him. (Ms. Lewinsky suspected that he actually had read the whole 
thing.)<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_509_"><SUP>(509)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky complained about his failure to get her a White House job after her 
long wait. Although the President claimed he wanted to be her friend, she said, 
he was not acting like it. Ms. Lewinsky began weeping, and the President hugged 
her. While they hugged, she spotted a gardener outside the study window, and 
they moved into the hallway by the bathroom.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_510_"><SUP>(510)</SUP></A> 
<P>There, the President was "the most affectionate with me he'd ever been," Ms. 
Lewinsky testified. He stroked her arm, toyed with her hair, kissed her on the 
neck, praised her intellect and beauty.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_511_"><SUP>(511)</SUP></A> In 
Ms. Lewinsky's recollection: 
<P>[H]e remarked . . . that he wished he had more time for me. And so I said, 
well, maybe you will have more time in three years. And I was . . . thinking 
just when he wasn't President, he was going to have more time on his hands. And 
he said, well, I don't know, I might be alone in three years. And then I said 
something about . . . us sort of being together. I think I kind of said, oh, I 
think we'd be a good team, or something like that. And he . . . jokingly said, 
well, what are we going to do when I'm 75 and I have to pee 25 times a day? And 
. . . I told him that we'd deal with that. . . .<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_512_"><SUP>(512)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that "I left that day sort of emotionally stunned," 
for "I just knew he was in love with me."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_513_"><SUP>(513)</SUP></A> 
<P>Just before leaving, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she told the President "that 
I wanted to talk to him about something serious and that while I didn't want to 
be the one to talk about this with him, I thought it was important he know."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_514_"><SUP>(514)</SUP></A> 
She informed him that <U>Newsweek</U> was working on an article about Kathleen 
Willey, a former White House volunteer who claimed that the President had 
sexually harassed her during a private meeting in the Oval Office on November 
23, 1993. (Ms. Lewinsky knew of the article from Ms. Tripp, who had worked at 
the White House at the time of the alleged incident and had heard about the 
incident from Ms. Willey. Michael Isikoff of <U>Newsweek</U> had talked with Ms. 
Tripp about the episode in March 1997 and again shortly before July 4, and Ms. 
Tripp had subsequently related the Isikoff conversations to Ms. Lewinsky.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_515_"><SUP>(515)</SUP></A>) 
Ms. Lewinsky told the President what she had learned from Ms. Tripp (whom she 
did not name), including the fact that Ms. Tripp had tried to get in touch with 
Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey, who had not returned her calls.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_516_"><SUP>(516)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified about why she conveyed this information to the 
President: "I was concerned that the President had no idea this was going on and 
that this woman was going to be another Paula Jones and he didn't really need 
that."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_517_"><SUP>(517)</SUP></A> 
She understood that Ms. Willey was looking for a job, and she thought that the 
President might be able to "make this go away" by finding her a job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_518_"><SUP>(518)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President responded that the harassment allegation was ludicrous, because 
he would never approach a small-breasted woman like Ms. Willey.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_519_"><SUP>(519)</SUP></A> He 
further said that, during the previous week, Ms. Willey had called Nancy 
Hernreich to warn that a reporter was working on a story about Ms. Willey and 
the President; Ms. Willey wondered how she could get out of it.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_520_"><SUP>(520)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President had no telephone calls during her 
time with him. At 10:19 a.m., probably after her departure (her exit time is not 
shown on logs), he placed two calls, both potentially follow-ups to the 
conversation about the <U>Newsweek</U> article. First, he spoke with Bruce 
Lindsey for three minutes, then with Nancy Hernreich for 11 minutes.<A

<P>On the evening of Monday, July 14, 1997, just after Ms. Lewinsky had returned 
from an overseas trip, the President had her come to the White House to discuss 
Linda Tripp and <U>Newsweek</U>.<A

Ms. Lewinsky entered the White House at 9:34 p.m. and exited at 11:22 p.m.<A

The President was in the Oval Office area from 9:28 to 11:25 p.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_524_"><SUP>(524)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that, at around 7:30 p.m. that evening, Ms. Currie 
telephoned and said that the President wanted to talk to her or see her. At 
about 8:30 or 9:00 p.m., Ms. Currie called again and asked Ms. Lewinsky to come 
to the White House.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_525_"><SUP>(525)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that the President met her in Ms. Currie's office, 
then took her into Ms. Hernreich's office.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_526_"><SUP>(526)</SUP></A> 
(Records show that seven minutes after Ms. Lewinsky's entry to the White House 
complex, the President left the Oval Office for the appointment secretary's 
office.)<A

According to Ms. Lewinsky: 
<P>It was an unusual meeting . . . . It was very distant and very cold. . . . 
[A]t one point he asked me if the woman that I had mentioned on July 4th was 
Linda Tripp. And I hesitated and then answered yes, and he talked about that 
there was some issue . . . to do with Kathleen Willey and that, as he called it, 
that there was something on the Sludge Report, that there had been some 
information.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_528_"><SUP>(528)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President told Ms. Lewinsky that Ms. Willey had called the White House 
again, this time to report that Mr. Isikoff somehow knew of her earlier White 
House call.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_529_"><SUP>(529)</SUP></A> 
The President wondered if Ms. Lewinsky had mentioned the Willey call to Ms. 
Tripp, who in turn might have told Mr. Isikoff. Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged that 
she had done so. Ms. Lewinsky testified: "[H]e was concerned about Linda, and I 
reassured him. He asked me if I trusted her, and I said yes."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_530_"><SUP>(530)</SUP></A> 
The President asked Ms. Lewinsky to try to persuade Ms. Tripp to call Mr. 
Lindsey.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_531_"><SUP>(531)</SUP></A> 
The President, according to Ms. Lewinsky, also asked if she had confided 
anything about their relationship to Ms. Tripp. Ms. Lewinsky said (falsely) that 
she had not.<A

<P>The President left to participate in a conference call, which Ms. Lewinsky 
understood was with his attorneys, while Ms. Lewinsky sat with Ms. Currie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_533_"><SUP>(533)</SUP></A> 
According to White House records, at 10:03 p.m. the President participated in a 
51-minute conference call with Robert Bennett, his private attorney in the 
<U>Jones</U> case, and Charles Ruff, White House Counsel. Immediately after 
completing that call, the President had a six-minute phone conversation with 
Bruce Lindsey.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_534_"><SUP>(534)</SUP></A> 
<P>Afterward, the President returned and told Ms. Lewinsky, in her recollection, 
to notify Ms. Currie the following day, "without getting into details with her, 
even mentioning names with her," whether Ms. Lewinsky had 
"'mission-accomplished' . . . with Linda."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_535_"><SUP>(535)</SUP></A> 
<P>The next day, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she did talk with Ms. Tripp, then 
called Ms. Currie and said she needed to talk with the President. He called her 
that evening. She told him "that I had tried to talk to Linda and that she 
didn't seem very receptive to trying to get in touch with Bruce Lindsey again, 
but that I would continue to try."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_536_"><SUP>(536)</SUP></A> 
The President was in a sour mood, according to Ms. Lewinsky, and their

Ms. Scott said she would try to detail Ms. Lewinsky from the Pentagon to Ms. 
Scott's office on a temporary basis, according to Ms. Lewinsky.<A

that way, Ms. Scott said, Ms. Lewinsky could prove herself. Ms. Scott also said 
that "they had to be careful and protect [the President]."<A

Both Ms. Scott and Ms. Currie confirmed that Ms. Scott talked with Ms. Lewinsky 
about the possibility of being detailed to work at the White House.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_541_"><SUP>(541)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Scott testified that she tried to arrange the detail on her own, without any 
direction from the President; Ms. Currie, however, testified that the President 
instructed her and Ms. Scott to try to get Ms. Lewinsky a job.<A

<P>On Thursday, July 24, 1997, the day after her 24th birthday, Ms. Lewinsky 
visited the White House from 6:04 to 6:26 p.m., admitted by Ms. Currie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_543_"><SUP>(543)</SUP></A> 
The President was in the Oval Office when she arrived; he moved to the study at 
6:14 p.m. and remained there until her departure.<A

had no telephone calls during Ms. Lewinsky's visit.<A

<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she went to the White House to pick up a 
photograph from Ms. Currie, who said the President might be available for a 
quick meeting. Ms. Currie put Ms. Lewinsky in the Cabinet Room while the 
President finished another meeting, then took her to see him. They chatted for 
five to ten minutes, and the President gave Ms. Lewinsky, as a birthday present, 
an antique pin.<A

<P><A name=L74><STRONG>G. <U>Newsweek</U> Article and Its Aftermath</STRONG> 
<P><U>Newsweek</U> published the Kathleen Willey story in its August 11, 1997, 
edition (which appeared a week before the cover date). The article quoted Ms. 
Tripp as saying that Ms. Willey, after leaving the Oval Office on the day of the 
President's alleged advances, looked "disheveled," "flustered, happy, and 
joyful." The article also quoted Robert Bennett as saying that Ms. Tripp was 
"not to be believed."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_547_"><SUP>(547)</SUP></A> 
<P>After the article appeared, Ms. Tripp wrote a letter to <U>Newsweek</U> 
charging that she had been misquoted, but the magazine did not publish it.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_548_"><SUP>(548)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky subsequently told the President about Ms. Tripp's letter. He 
replied, Ms. Lewinsky said in a recorded conversation, "Well, that's good 
because it sure seemed like she screwed me from that article."<A

<P><A name=L75><STRONG>H. August 16 Meeting</STRONG> 
<P>On Saturday, August 16, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky tried, unsuccessfully, to resume 
her sexual relationship with the President. She visited the White House on that 
day from 9:02 to 10:20 a.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_550_"><SUP>(550)</SUP></A> 
The President moved from the Residence to the Oval Office at 9:20 a.m. and 
remained in the Oval Office until 10:03 a.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_551_"><SUP>(551)</SUP></A> 
After a one-minute call to Betty Currie at her desk at 9:18 a.m., evidently from 
the Residence, the President had no calls while Ms. Lewinsky was at the White 
House.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_552_"><SUP>(552)</SUP></A> 
The next day he left for a vacation on Martha's Vineyard.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_553_"><SUP>(553)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that she brought birthday gifts for the President (his 
birthday is August 19): 
<P>I had set up in his back office, I had brought an apple square and put a 
candle and had put his birthday presents out. And after he came back in and I 
sang happy birthday and he got his presents, I asked him . . . if we could share 
a birthday kiss in honor of our birthdays, because mine had been just a few 
weeks before. So, he said that that was okay and we could kind of bend the rules 
that day. And so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we kissed.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_554_"><SUP>(554)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky touched the President's genitals through his pants and moved to 
perform oral sex, but the President rebuffed her.<A

her recollection: "[H]e said, I'm trying not to do this and I'm trying to be 
good.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [H]e got visibly upset. And so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I 
hugged him and I told him I was sorry and not to be upset."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_556_"><SUP>(556)</SUP></A> 
Later, in a draft note to "Handsome," Ms. Lewinsky referred to this visit: "It 
was awful when I saw you for your birthday in August. You were so distant that I 
missed you as I was holding you in my arms."<A

minutes.<A

According to notes that Ms. Lewinsky wrote to two friends, Ms. Scott told her 
that the detail slot in her office had been eliminated.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_559_"><SUP>(559)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky told one friend: 
<P>So for now, there isn't any place for me to be detailed. So I should be 
PATIENT. I told her I was very upset and disappointed (even though I really 
didn't want to work for her) and then she and I got into it. She didn't 
understand why I wanted to come back when there were still people there who 
would give me a hard time and that it isn't the right political climate for me 
to come back. . . . She asked me why I kept pushing the envelope on coming back 
there -- after all, I had the experience of being there already. So it's over. I 
don't know what I will do now but I can't wait any more and I can't go through 
all of this crap anymore. In some ways I hope I never hear from him again 
because he'll just lead me on because he doesn't have the balls to tell me the 
truth.<A

<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Scott testified that "[t]he gist" of Ms. Lewinsky's email message 
describing the conversation "fits with what I remember telling her."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_561_"><SUP>(561)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky expressed her escalating frustration in a note to the President 
that she drafted (but did not send).<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_562_"><SUP>(562)</SUP></A> 
She wrote: 
<P>I believe the time has finally come for me to throw in the towel. My 
conversation with Marsha left me disappointed, frustrated, sad and angry. I 
can't help but wonder if you knew she wouldn't be able to detail me over there 
when I last saw you. Maybe that would explain your coldness. The only 
explanation I can reason for your not bringing me back is that you just plain 
didn't want to enough or care about me enough. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky went on to discuss other women rumored to be involved with the 
President who enjoy "golden positions," above criticism, "because they have your 
approval." She continued: "I just loved you -- wanted to spend time with you, 
kiss you, listen to you laugh -- and I wanted you to love me back." She closed: 
"As I said in my last letter to you I've waited long enough. You and Marsha win. 
I give up. You let me down, but I 
<P>shouldn't have trusted you in the first place.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_563_"><SUP>(563)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky continued trying to discuss her situation with the President. On 
Friday, September 12, 1997, she arrived at the White House without an 
appointment, called Ms. Currie, and had a long wait at the gate. When Ms. Currie 
came to meet her, Ms. Lewinsky was crying. Ms. Currie explained that sometimes 
the President's hands are tied -- but, she said, she had gotten his 
authorization to ask John Podesta, the Deputy Chief of Staff, to help Ms. 
Lewinsky return to work at the White House.<A

<P><A name=L77><STRONG>J. Black Dog Gifts</STRONG> 
<P>Before the President had left for vacation, Ms. Lewinsky had sent a note 
asking if he could bring her a T-shirt from the Black Dog, a popular Vineyard 
restaurant.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_565_"><SUP>(565)</SUP></A> In 
early September, Ms. Currie gave several Black Dog items to Ms. Lewinsky.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_566_"><SUP>(566)</SUP></A> In 
an email message to Catherine Davis, Ms. Lewinsky wrote: "Well, I found out from 
Betty yesterday that he not only brought me a t-shirt, he got me 2 t-shirts, a 
hat and a dress!!!! Even though he's a big schmuck, that is surprisingly sweet 
-- even that he remembered!"<A

<P>A letter dated September 30, 1997, styled as an official memo, was found in 
Ms. Lewinsky's apartment. According to Ms. Lewinsky, she sent this letter or a 
similar one to the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_568_"><SUP>(568)</SUP></A> 
Addressed to "Handsome" and bearing the subject line "The New Deal," the faux 
memo proposed a visit that evening after "everyone else goes home." Ms. Lewinsky 
wrote: "You will show me that you will let me visit you sans a crisis, and I 
will be on my best behavior and not stressed out when I come (to see you, that 
is)." She closed with an allusion to a woman rumored to have been involved with 
an earlier President: "Oh, and Handsome, remember FDR would never have turned 
down a visit with Lucy Mercer!"<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_569_"><SUP>(569)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky did not visit the White House the night of September 30, but the 
President called her late the night of September 30 or October 1.<A

According to Ms. Lewinsky, he may have mentioned during this call that he would 
get Erskine Bowles to help her find a White House job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_571_"><SUP>(571)</SUP></A> 
<P>At around this time, the President did ask the White House Chief of Staff to 
help in the job search. Mr. Bowles testified about a conversation with the 
President in the Oval Office: "He told me that there was a young woman -- her 
name was Monica Lewinsky -- who used to work at the White House; that Evelyn 
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thought she hung around the Oval Office too much and transferred 
her to the Pentagon."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_572_"><SUP>(572)</SUP></A> 
The President asked Mr. Bowles to try to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in the Old 
Executive Office Building.<A

Mr. Bowles assigned his deputy, John Podesta, to handle it.<A

<P><A name=L79><STRONG>L. News of Job Search Failure </STRONG>
<P>On October 6, 1997, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she was told that she would 
never work at the White House again. Ms. Tripp conveyed the news, which she 
indicated had come from a friend on the White House staff. Ms. Lewinsky 
testified: 
<P>Linda Tripp called me at work on October 6th and told me that her friend Kate 
in the NSC . . . had heard rumors about me and that I would never work in the 
White House again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [Kate's] advice to me was "get out of

was the "straw that broke the camel's back."<A

She was enraged.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_577_"><SUP>(577)</SUP></A> 
<P>In a note she drafted (but did not send), Ms. Lewinsky expressed her 
frustration. She wrote: 
<P>Any normal person would have walked away from this and said, "He doesn't call 
me, he doesn't want to see me -- screw it. It doesn't matter." I can't let go of 
you. . . . I want to be a source of pleasure and laughter and energy to you. I 
want to make you smile. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>She went on to relate that she had heard second-hand from a White House 
employee "that I was 'after the President' and would never be allowed to work 
[in] the complex." Ms. Lewinsky said she could only conclude "that all you have 
promised me is an empty promise. . . . I am once again totally humiliated. It is 
very clear that there is no way I am going to be brought back." She closed the 
note: "I will never do anything to hurt you. I am simply not that kind of 
person. Moreover, I love you."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_578_"><SUP>(578)</SUP></A> 
<P>When terminating their sexual relationship on May 24, the President had told 
Ms. Lewinsky that he hoped they would remain friends, for he could do a great 
deal for her.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_579_"><SUP>(579)</SUP></A> 
Now, having learned that he could not (or would not) get her a White House job, 
Ms. Lewinsky decided to ask him for a job in New York, perhaps at the United 
Nations -- a possibility that she had mentioned to him in passing over the 
summer. On the afternoon of October 6, Ms. Lewinsky spoke of this plan to Ms. 
Currie, who quoted the President as having said earlier: "Oh, that's no problem. 
We can place her in the UN like that."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_580_"><SUP>(580)</SUP></A> 
<P>In a recorded conversation later on October 6, Ms. Lewinsky said she wanted 
two things from the President. The first was contrition: He needed to 
"acknowledge . . . that he helped fuck up my life."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_581_"><SUP>(581)</SUP></A> 
The second was a job, one that she could obtain without much effort: "I don't 
want to have to work for this position . . . . I just want it to be given to 
me."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_582_"><SUP>(582)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky decided to write the President a note proposing that the two of 
them "get together and work on some way that I can come out of this situation 
not feeling the way I do."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_583_"><SUP>(583)</SUP></A> 
After composing the letter, she said: "I want him to feel a little guilty, and I 
hope that this letter did that."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_584_"><SUP>(584)</SUP></A> 
<P>In this letter, which was sent via courier on October 7, Ms. Lewinsky said 
she understood that she would never be given a White House job, and she asked 
for a prompt meeting to discuss her job situation.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_585_"><SUP>(585)</SUP></A> 
She went on to advance a specific request: 
<P>I'd like to ask you to help me secure a position in NY beginning 1 December. 
I would be very grateful, and I am hoping this is a solution for both of us. I 
want you to know that it has always been and remains more important to me to

Ms. Lewinsky told him that she wanted a job in New York by the end of October,

<P><A name=L83><STRONG>B. October 11 Meeting </STRONG>
<P>At approximately 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, October 11, according to Ms. 
Lewinsky, Ms. Currie called and told her that the President wished to see her.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_596_"><SUP>(596)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky entered the White House at 9:36 a.m. and departed at 10:54 a.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_597_"><SUP>(597)</SUP></A> 
The President entered the Oval Office at 9:52 a.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_598_"><SUP>(598)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky met with the President in the study, and they discussed her job 
search.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_599_"><SUP>(599)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky told the President that she wanted to pursue jobs in the private 
sector, and he told her to prepare a list of New York companies that interested 
her.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_600_"><SUP>(600)</SUP></A> 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky asked the President whether Vernon Jordan, a well-known 
Washington attorney who she knew was a close friend of the President and had 
many business contacts, might help her find a job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_601_"><SUP>(601)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President was receptive to the idea.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_602_"><SUP>(602)</SUP></A> 
<P>In a recorded conversation, Ms. Lewinsky said that, at the end of the October 
11 meeting, she and the President joined Ms. Currie in the Oval Office. The 
President grabbed Ms. Lewinsky's arm and kissed her on the forehead.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_603_"><SUP>(603)</SUP></A> He 
told her: "I talked to Erskine [Bowles] about . . . trying to get John Hilley to 
give you . . . a good recommendation for your work here."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_604_"><SUP>(604)</SUP></A> 
<P>Later, Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp discussed their concerns about the 
President's involvement in Ms. Lewinsky's job search. Specifically, Ms. Lewinsky 
was nervous about involving the President's Chief of Staff: 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky: Well, see, I don't really think -- I'm going to tell him that I 
don't think Erskine should have anything to do with this. I don't think anybody 
who works there should. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Tripp: I don't see how that's -- how that's a problem. 
<P>
<P>Ms. Lewinsky: Because look at what happened with Webb Hubbell.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_605_"><SUP>(605)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky preferred that Vernon Jordan assist her in her job search: 
<P>Ms. Tripp: Well, I don't remember during the Webb Hubbell thing, was Vernon 
mentioned? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky: Yeah, but there's a big difference. I think somebody could 
construe, okay? Somebody could construe or say, "Well, they gave her a job to 
shut her up. They made her happy. . . . And he [Mr. Bowles] works for the 
government and shouldn't have done that." And with the other one [Mr. Jordan] 
you can't say that.<A

<P><A name=L84><STRONG>C. October 16-17: The "Wish List</STRONG>" 
<P>On October 16, Ms. Lewinsky sent the President a packet, which included what 
she called a "wish list" describing the types of jobs that interested her in New 
York City.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_607_"><SUP>(607)</SUP></A> 
The note began: My dream had been to work in Communications or Strategic 
Planning at the White House. I am open to any suggestions that you may have on 
work that is similar to that or may intrigue me. The most important things to me 
are that I am engaged and interested in my work, I am <U>not</U> someone's 
administrative/ executive assistant, and my salary can provide me a comfortable 
living in NY.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_608_"><SUP>(608)</SUP></A> 
<P>She identified five public relations firms where she would like to work.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_609_"><SUP>(609)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky concluded by saying of the United Nations: 
<P>I do not have any interest in working there. As a result of what happened in 
April '96, I have already spent a year and a half at an agency in which I have 
no interest. I want a job where I feel challenged, engaged, and interested. I 
don't think the UN is the right place for me.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_610_"><SUP>(610)</SUP></A> 
<P>In a recorded conversation, Ms. Lewinsky said she wanted the President to 
take her list seriously and not ask her to settle for a U.N. job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_611_"><SUP>(611)</SUP></A> 
She said she hoped "that if he starts to pick a bone with me and the U.N., he 
sure as hell doesn't do it on the phone. . . . I don't want to start getting 
into a screaming match with him on the phone."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_612_"><SUP>(612)</SUP></A> 
<P>In addition to the "wish list," Ms. Lewinsky said she enclosed in the packet 
a pair of sunglasses and "a lot of things in a little envelope," including some 
jokes, a card, and a postcard.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_613_"><SUP>(613)</SUP></A> 
She said that she had written on the card: "Wasn't I right that my hugs are 
better in person than in cards?"<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_614_"><SUP>(614)</SUP></A> 
The postcard featured a "very erotic" Egon Schiele painting.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_615_"><SUP>(615)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky also enclosed a note with her thoughts on education reform.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_616_"><SUP>(616)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that she felt that the President owed her a job for 
several reasons: Her relationship with him was the reason she had been 
transferred out of the White House; he had promised her a job and so far had 
done nothing to help her find one; and she had left the White House "quietly," 
without making an issue of her relationship with the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_617_"><SUP>(617)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L85><STRONG>D. The President Creates Options</STRONG> 
<P>At some point around this time in the fall of 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Currie asked 
John Podesta, the Deputy Chief of Staff, to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New 
York.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_618_"><SUP>(618)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Podesta testified that, during a Presidential trip to Latin America, he 
approached then-U.N. Ambassador William Richardson while aboard Air Force One 
and asked the Ambassador to consider a former White House intern for a position 
at the U.N.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_619_"><SUP>(619)</SUP></A> At 
the time, Mr. Podesta could not recall the intern's name.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_620_"><SUP>(620)</SUP></A> 
Ambassador Richardson and the President both testified that they never discussed 
Ms. Lewinsky with each other.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_621_"><SUP>(621)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ambassador Richardson returned from Latin America on Sunday, October 19.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_622_"><SUP>(622)</SUP></A> 
Within a few days, his Executive Assistant, Isabelle Watkins, called Mr. 
Podesta's secretary and asked whether "she knew anything about a resume that 
John was going to send us."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_623_"><SUP>(623)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Podesta's secretary knew nothing about it and asked Mr. Podesta what to do; 
he instructed her to call Ms.&nbsp;Currie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_624_"><SUP>(624)</SUP></A> At 
3:09 p.m. on October 21, Ms. Currie faxed Ms. Lewinsky's resume to the United 
Nations.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_625_"><SUP>(625)</SUP></A> 
<P>At 7:01 p.m., a six-minute call was placed to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment from a 
U.N. telephone number identified in State Department records as "Ambassador 
Richardson's line."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_626_"><SUP>(626)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky testified that she spoke to Ambassador Richardson. A woman called, 
Ms. Lewinsky testified, and said, "[H]old for Ambassador Richardson."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_627_"><SUP>(627)</SUP></A> 
Then the Ambassador himself came on the line: "I remember, because I was shocked 
and I was . . . very nervous."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_628_"><SUP>(628)</SUP></A> 
The purpose of the call was to schedule a job interview at a Watergate apartment 
the following week.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_629_"><SUP>(629)</SUP></A> At 
odds with Ms. Lewinsky, the Ambassador and Ms. Watkins both testified that Ms. 
Watkins, not the Ambassador, spoke with Ms. Lewinsky.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_630_"><SUP>(630)</SUP></A> 
<P>A few days later, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President called her. She 
had been upset because no one at the White House had prepared her for the 
Ambassador's recent call and because she did not want the White House to 
railroad her into taking the U.N. job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_631_"><SUP>(631)</SUP></A> 
She reiterated that she was eager to pursue other opportunities, especially in 
the private sector.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_632_"><SUP>(632)</SUP></A> 
The President reassured her, promising that a U.N. position was just one of many 
options.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_633_"><SUP>(633)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky spoke to the President again one week later. Ms. Lewinsky 
testified that she told Ms. Currie to ask the President to call her to assuage 
her nervousness before the U.N. interview.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_634_"><SUP>(634)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, on October 30, the night before the interview, the 
President did call. She characterized the conversation as a "pep talk": "[H]e 
was trying to kind of build my confidence and reassure me."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_635_"><SUP>(635)</SUP></A> 
The President told her to call Ms. Currie after the interview.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_636_"><SUP>(636)</SUP></A>In 
his <U>Jones</U> deposition, the President indicated that he learned of her 
interview with Ambassador Richardson not from Ms. Lewinsky herself but from Ms. 
Currie.<A

<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P><A name=L86><STRONG>E. The U.N. Interview and Job Offer</STRONG> 
<P>On Friday morning, October 31, Ambassador Richardson and two of his 
assistants, Mona Sutphen and Rebecca Cooper, interviewed Ms. Lewinsky at the 
Watergate.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_638_"><SUP>(638)</SUP></A> 
According to Ambassador Richardson, he "listen[ed] while Mona and Rebecca were 
interviewing her."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_639_"><SUP>(639)</SUP></A> 
Neither Ambassador Richardson nor any of his staff made inquiries, before or 
after the interview, about Ms. Lewinsky's prior work performance.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_640_"><SUP>(640)</SUP></A> 
<P>On Sunday, November 2, Ms. Lewinsky drafted a letter to Ms. Currie asking 
what to do in the event she received an offer from the U.N.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_641_"><SUP>(641)</SUP></A> 
She wrote: 
<P>I became a bit nervous this weekend when I realized that Amb. Richardson said 
his staff would be in touch with me <EM>this week</EM>. As you know, the UN is 
supposed to be my back-up, but because VJ [Vernon Jordan] has been out of town, 
this is my only option right now. What should I say to Richardson's people this 
week when they call?<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_642_"><SUP>(642)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky asked Ms. Currie to speak to the President about her problem: 
"If you feel it's appropriate, maybe you could ask 'the big guy' what he wants 
me to do. Ahhhhh . . . anxiety!!!!!"<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_643_"><SUP>(643)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky also mentioned the President's promise to involve Vernon Jordan in 
her job search: 
<P>I don't think I told you that in my conversation last Thursday night with him 
that he said that he would ask you to set up a meeting between VJ and myself, 
once VJ got back. I assume he'll mention this to you at some point -- hopefully 
sooner rather than later!<A

<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Before Ms. Lewinsky sent this letter, in her recollection, she received an 
offer from the U.N.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_645_"><SUP>(645)</SUP></A> 
Phone records reflect that, at 11:02 a.m. on November 3, a three-minute call was 
placed to Ms. Lewinsky from the U.N. line identified in State Department records 
as Ambassador Richardson's.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_646_"><SUP>(646)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky stated that she believes she spoke to Ambassador Richardson, who 
extended her a job offer.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_647_"><SUP>(647)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to his assistant, Ambassador Richardson made the decision to hire 
Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Sutphen testified: 
<P>I said, are you sure; and he said, yeah, yeah, I'm sure, why. And I said . . 
. are you sure, though you don't want to talk to anyone else . . . . And he 
said, no, no, I think it's fine; why don't you go ahead and give her an offer?<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_648_"><SUP>(648)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ambassador Richardson and Ms. Sutphen both testified that Ms. Sutphen, not 
the Ambassador, extended the job offer to Ms. Lewinsky. They recalled that the 
offer was made a week or 10 days after the interview, though Ms. Sutphen, when 
shown the phone records, testified that the November 3 call to Ms. Lewinsky 
probably was the job offer.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_649_"><SUP>(649)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that she told Ms. Currie about the offer and she 
probably also told the President directly.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_650_"><SUP>(650)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie first testified that she had "probably" told the President about Ms. 
Lewinsky's U.N. offer, then testified that she had in fact told him, then 
testified that she could not remember, though she acknowledged that the 
President was interested in Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky's getting a job.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_651_"><SUP>(651)</SUP></A> 
<P>When the President was asked in the <U>Jones</U> deposition whether he knew 
that Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had received the offer of a job at the U.N., he 
testified: "I know that she interviewed for one. I don't know if she was offered 
one or not."<A

<P><A name=L87><STRONG>F. The U.N. Job Offer Declined</STRONG> 
<P>Three weeks after she received an offer, on November 24, Ms. Lewinsky called 
Ms. Sutphen and asked for more time to consider the offer because she wanted to 
pursue possibilities in the private sector.<A

Ms. Sutphen told Ambassador Richardson, who, according to Ms. Sutphen, said the 
delay would be fine.<A

Over a month later, on January 5, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky finally turned down the

<P align=center><A name=L88><STRONG>X. November 1997: Growing 
Frustration</STRONG> <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky met with Vernon Jordan, who promised to help her find a job in 
New York. November proved, however, to be a month of inactivity with respect to 
both Ms. Lewinsky's job search and her relationship with the President. Mr. 
Jordan did not meet with Ms. Lewinsky again, nor did he contact anyone in New 
York City on her behalf. Ms. Lewinsky became increasingly anxious about her 
inability to see the President. Except for a momentary encounter in 
mid-November, Ms. Lewinsky did not meet with the President between October 11 
and December 5. 
<P><A name=L89><STRONG>A. Interrogatories Answered</STRONG> 
<P>On November 3, 1997, the President answered Paula Jones's Second Set of 
Interrogatories. Two of those interrogatories asked the President to list any

to have" sexual relations during the time that he was Attorney General of 
Arkansas, Governor of Arkansas, and President of the United States.<A

Mr. Jordan likewise testified that, in his understanding, the President was 
behind Ms. Currie's request.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_663_"><SUP>(663)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Currie testified at various points that she contacted Mr. Jordan on her 
own initiative; that the President "probably" talked with her about Ms. 
Lewinsky's New York job hunt; and that she could not recall whether the 
President was involved.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_664_"><SUP>(664)</SUP></A> In 
his <U>Jones</U> deposition, the President was asked whether he did anything to 
facilitate a meeting between Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky. He testified: 
<P>I can tell you what my memory is. My memory is that Vernon said something to 
me about her coming in, Betty had called and asked if he [Mr. Jordan] would see 
her [Ms. Lewinsky].&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . I'm sure if he said something to me about it 
I said something positive about it. I wouldn't have said anything negative about 
it.<A

<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>When pressed, the President testified that he did not think that he was the 
"precipitating force" in arranging the meeting between Mr. Jordan and Ms. 
Lewinsky.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_666_"><SUP>(666)</SUP></A> 
<P>At 8:50 a.m. on November 5, Mr. Jordan spoke with the President by telephone 
for five minutes.<A

Later that morning, Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky met in his office for about 
twenty minutes.<A

She told him that she intended to move to New York, and she named several 
companies where she hoped to work.<A

She showed him the "wish list" that she had sent the President on October 16.<A

Concerning her job search, Mr. Jordan said: "We're in business."<A

<P>In the course of the day, Mr. Jordan placed four calls to Ms. Hernreich (whom 
he acknowledged calling when he wished to speak to the President<A

and one to Ms. Currie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_674_"><SUP>(674)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Jordan testified that he could not remember the calls, but "[i]t is entirely 
possible" that they concerned Monica Lewinsky.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_675_"><SUP>(675)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr. Jordan also visited the White House and met with the President at 2:00 
p.m. that day.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_676_"><SUP>(676)</SUP></A> 
Again, Mr. Jordan testified that he had "no recollection" of the substance of 
his conversation with the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_677_"><SUP>(677)</SUP></A> 
<P>On November 6, the day after meeting with Mr. Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky wrote him 
a thank-you letter: "It made me happy to know that our friend has such a 
wonderful confidant in you."<A

to hear from Mr. Jordan "later next week."<A

The evidence indicates, though, that Mr. Jordan took no steps to help Ms. 
Lewinsky until early December, after she appeared on the witness list in the 
<U>Jones</U> case. 
<P>Mr. Jordan initially testified that he had "no recollection of having met 
with Ms. Lewinsky on November 5."<A

meeting was "entirely possible."<A

Mr. Jordan's failure to remember his November meeting with Ms. Lewinsky may

for a few hours on Thursday and I could come see him then."<A

<P>The following morning, November 13, Ms. Lewinsky tried to arrange a visit 
with the President. She called repeatedly but suspected that Ms. Currie was not 
telling the President of her calls.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_692_"><SUP>(692)</SUP></A> 
Around noon, Ms. Currie told Ms. Lewinsky that the President had left to play 
golf. Ms. Lewinsky, in her own words, "went ballistic."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_693_"><SUP>(693)</SUP></A> 
<P>After the President returned from the Army-Navy Golf Course in the late 
afternoon, Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Currie that she was coming to the White House 
to give him some gifts.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_694_"><SUP>(694)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie suggested that Ms. Lewinsky wait in Ms. Currie's car in the White 
House parking lot. Ms. Lewinsky went to the White House only to find that the 
doors to Ms. Currie's car were locked. Ms. Lewinsky waited in the rain.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_695_"><SUP>(695)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Currie eventually met her in the parking lot, and, in Ms. Lewinsky's 
words, they made a "bee-line" into the White House, sneaking up the back stairs 
to avoid other White House employees, particularly Presidential aide Stephen 
Goodin.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_696_"><SUP>(696)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky left two small gifts for the President with Ms. Currie, then waited 
alone for about half an hour in the Oval Office study.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_697_"><SUP>(697)</SUP></A> In 
the study, Ms. Lewinsky saw several gifts she had given the President, including 
<U>Oy Vey! The Things They Say: A Guide to Jewish Wit</U>, Nicholson Baker's 
novel <U>Vox</U>, and a letter opener decorated with a frog.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_698_"><SUP>(698)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President finally joined Ms. Lewinsky in the study, where they were alone 
for only a minute or two.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_699_"><SUP>(699)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky gave him an antique paperweight in the shape of the White House.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_700_"><SUP>(700)</SUP></A> 
She also showed him an email describing the effect of chewing Altoid mints 
before performing oral sex. Ms. Lewinsky was chewing Altoids at the time, but 
the President replied that he did not have enough time for oral sex.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_701_"><SUP>(701)</SUP></A> 
They kissed, and the President rushed off for a State Dinner with President 
Zedillo.<A

<P><A name=L92><STRONG>D. November 14-December 4: Inability to See the 
President</STRONG> 
<P>After this brief November 13 meeting, Ms. Lewinsky did not see the President 
again until the first week in December. Hoping to arrange a longer rendezvous, 
she sent the President several notes, as well as a cassette on which she 
recorded a message.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_703_"><SUP>(703)</SUP></A> 
<P>Along with her chagrin over not seeing the President, Ms. Lewinsky was 
frustrated that her job search had apparently stalled. A few days before 
Thanksgiving, she complained to Ms. Currie that she had not heard from Mr. 
Jordan.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_704_"><SUP>(704)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie arranged for her to speak with him "before Thanksgiving," while Ms. 
Lewinsky was in Los Angeles. Mr. Jordan told her to call him the following week 
to arrange another meeting.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_705_"><SUP>(705)</SUP></A> 
<P>In draft letters to the President, which were recovered from her Pentagon 
computer, Ms. Lewinsky reflected on the change in their relationship: "[B]oth 
professionally and personally, . . . our personal relationship changing has 
caused me more pain. Do you realize that?"<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_706_"><SUP>(706)</SUP></A> 
She asked for the President's understanding: "I don't want you to think that I 
am not grateful for what you are doing for me now -- I'd probably be in a mental 
institute without it -- but I am consumed with this disappointment, frustration, 
and anger." Ms. Lewinsky rued the brevity of her November 13 visit with the 
President: "All you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . ever have to do to pacify me is see me and 
hold me," she wrote. "Maybe that's asking too much."<A

Ms. Lewinsky reminded the President of his words during their October 10

to deliver the letter and gifts to the President. The gifts included a sterling

antique book about Theodore Roosevelt.<A

Lewinsky that the President would be busy with his lawyers and unable to see 
her.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_722_"><SUP>(722)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky arrived at the White House at approximately 10:00&nbsp;a.m. She 
told the Secret Service uniformed officers at the Northwest Gate that she had 
gifts to drop off for the President, but that Ms. Currie did not know she was 
coming.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_723_"><SUP>(723)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky and the officers made several calls in an attempt to locate Ms. 
Currie.<A

The officers eventually invited Ms. Lewinsky inside the guard booth.<A

When Ms. Currie learned that Ms. Lewinsky was at the Northwest Gate, she sent 
word that the President "already had a guest in the [O]val," so the officers 
should have Ms. Lewinsky wait there for about 40 minutes.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_726_"><SUP>(726)</SUP></A> 
<P>While Ms. Lewinsky was waiting, one officer mentioned that Eleanor Mondale 
was in the White House.<A

Ms. Lewinsky correctly surmised that the President was meeting with Ms. Mondale, 
rather than his lawyers, and she was "livid."<A

She stormed away, called and berated Ms. Currie from a pay phone, and then 
returned to her Watergate apartment.<A

<P>Hands shaking and almost crying, Ms. Currie informed several Secret Service

fired."<A

<P>Then, to Ms. Lewinsky's surprise, the President invited her to visit him.<A

<P>Later that day (December 6), the uniformed Secret Service officers at the 
Northwest Gate were told that no one would be fired -- so long as they remained 
quiet. According to Sergeant Williams, Ms. Currie said that, if the officers did 
not "tell a lot of people what had happened, then nothing would happen."<A

for the uniformed division at the time, "I hope you use your discretion."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_743_"><SUP>(743)</SUP></A> 
Captain Purdie interpreted the President's remark to mean that Captain Purdie 
"wasn't going to say anything," and he in turn told all of the officers involved 
not to discuss the incident.<A

One officer recalled that Captain Purdie told him and other officers, "Whatever 
just happened didn't happen."<A

Captain Purdie told another officer, "I was just in the Oval Office with the

order to document the incident.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_747_"><SUP>(747)</SUP></A> 
<P>Captain Purdie recommended to his supervisor, Deputy Chief Charles O'Malley, 
that "no paperwork be generated" regarding the Northwest Gate incident because 
"Ms. Currie was satisfied with the way things were handled."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_748_"><SUP>(748)</SUP></A> 
According to Captain Purdie, Deputy Chief O'Malley agreed, and no record of the 
incident was made.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_749_"><SUP>(749)</SUP></A> 
Deputy Chief O'Malley testified that the meeting between the President and 
Captain Purdie was the only occasion he could recall in fourteen years at the 
White House where a President directly addressed a job performance issue with a 
uniformed division supervisor.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_750_"><SUP>(750)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President was questioned in the grand jury about the incident at the 
Northwest Gate. He testified that he knew that Ms. Lewinsky had become upset 
upon learning that Ms. Mondale was in the White House "to see us that day."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_751_"><SUP>(751)</SUP></A> He 
testified: "As I remember, I had some other work to do that morning. . . . "<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_752_"><SUP>(752)</SUP></A> 
The President said that the disclosure of information that day was 
"inappropriate" and "a mistake," but he could not recall whether he wanted a 
Secret Service officer fired or gave any such orders.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_753_"><SUP>(753)</SUP></A> He 
thought that the officers "were . . . told not to let it happen again, and I 
think that's the way it should have been handled."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_754_"><SUP>(754)</SUP></A> 
When asked if he told Captain Purdie that he hoped that he could count on his 
discretion, the President stated, "I don't remember anything I said to him in 
that regard."<A

<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President later indicated to her that he had 
concerns about the discretion of the Secret Service uniformed officers. On 
December 28 she asked how Paula Jones's attorneys could have known enough to 
place her on the witness list. The President replied that the source might be 
Linda Tripp or "the uniformed officers."<A

Mr. Jordan testified that he was "fairly certain" that he did not discuss the 
<U>Jones</U> suit or Ms. Lewinsky.<A

<P>On Thursday, December 11, Ms. Lewinsky had her second meeting with Mr. 
Jordan.<A

Ms. Lewinsky testified that they discussed her job search, and Mr. Jordan told 
her to send letters to three business contacts that he provided her. Mr. Jordan 
noted that Ms. Lewinsky was anxious to get a job as quickly as possible, and he 
took action.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_764_"><SUP>(764)</SUP></A> In 
the course of the day, Mr. Jordan placed calls on her behalf to Peter Georgescu, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Young &amp; Rubicam; Richard Halperin, 
Executive Vice President and Special Counsel to the Chairman of MacAndrews &amp;

Mr. Jordan told Ms. Lewinsky to keep him informed of the progress of her job 
search.<A

<P>At one point in the conversation, according to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan said, 
"[Y]ou're a friend of the President."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_767_"><SUP>(767)</SUP></A> 
This prompted Ms. Lewinsky to reveal that she "didn't really look at him as the 
President"; rather, she "reacted to him more as a man and got angry at him like 
a man and just a regular person."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_768_"><SUP>(768)</SUP></A> 
When Mr. Jordan asked why Ms. Lewinsky got angry at the President, she replied 
that she became upset "when he doesn't call me enough or see me enough."<A

Ms. Lewinsky testified that Mr. Jordan advised her to take her frustrations out

According to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan summed up the situation: "You're in love,

<P>Mr. Jordan recalled a similar conversation, in which Ms. Lewinsky complained 
that the President did not see her enough, although he thought it took place 
during a meeting eight days later. He testified that he felt the need to remind 
Ms. Lewinsky that the President is the "leader of the free world" and has 
competing obligations.<A

Ms. Lewinsky at some point after this December 11 meeting.<A

told the President that he would be trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job in New 
York.<A

Mr. Jordan testified that the President "was aware that people were trying to

This was the first Paula Jones discovery request to refer to Monica Lewinsky by

<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that in the early-morning hours of December 17, at 
roughly 2:00 or 2:30&nbsp;a.m., she received a call from the President.<A

The call lasted about half an hour.<A

in the <U>Jones</U> case.<A

According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said "it broke his heart" to see her 
name on the witness list.<A

The President told her that she would not necessarily be subpoenaed; if she

inquiry and not be deposed."<A

subpoenaed.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_782_"><SUP>(782)</SUP></A> He 
also reviewed one of their established cover stories. He told Ms. Lewinsky that 
she "should say she visited the [White House] to see Ms. Currie and, on occasion 
when working at the [White House], she brought him letters when no one else was 
around."<A

The President's advice "was . . . instantly familiar to [Ms. Lewinsky]."<A

She testified that the President's use of this "misleading" story amounted to a 
continuation of their pre-existing pattern.<A

<P>Later in the conversation, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said he 
would try to get Ms. Currie to come in over the weekend so that Ms. Lewinsky 
could visit and he could give her several Christmas presents.<A

Ms. Lewinsky replied that, since Ms. Currie's brother had just died, perhaps 
they should "let Betty be."<A

<P>In his grand jury appearance, the President was questioned about the December 
17 phone call. He testified that, although he could not rule it out, he did not 
remember such a call.<A

The President was also asked whether in this conversation, or a conversation 
before Ms. Lewinsky's name came up in the <U>Jones</U> case, he instructed her

well have said that."<A

<P>But when asked whether he ever said anything along these lines <U>after</U> 
Ms. Lewinsky had been identified on the witness list, the President answered: "I 
don't recall whether I might have done something like that."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_790_"><SUP>(790)</SUP></A> He 
speculated that he might have suggested this explanation in the context of a 
call from a reporter.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_791_"><SUP>(791)</SUP></A> 
Nonetheless, he testified, in the context of the <U>Jones</U> case, "I never 
asked her to lie."<A

<P>On December 18, Ms. Lewinsky had two job interviews in New York City. At

<P>Ms. Lewinsky was served with a subpoena in the <U>Jones</U> case on Friday, 
December 19. She immediately called Mr. Jordan, and he invited her to his 
office. Mr. Jordan spoke with the President that afternoon and again that 
evening. He told the President that he had met with Ms. Lewinsky, that she had 
been subpoenaed, and that he planned to obtain an attorney for her. On Sunday, 
December 28, the President met with Ms. Lewinsky, who expressed concern about 
the subpoena's demand for the gifts he had given her. Later that day, Ms. Currie 
drove to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment and collected a box containing some of the 
subpoenaed gifts. Ms. Currie took the box home and hid it under her bed. 
<P><A name=L107><STRONG>A. December 19: Ms. Lewinsky Is Subpoenaed </STRONG>
<P>On Friday, December 19, 1997, sometime between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., Ms. 
Lewinsky was served with a subpoena at her Pentagon office.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_796_"><SUP>(796)</SUP></A> 
The subpoena commanded her to appear for a deposition in Washington, D.C., at 
9:30 a.m. on January 23, 1998.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_797_"><SUP>(797)</SUP></A> 
The subpoena also required the production of certain documents and gifts. Among 
the items that Ms. Lewinsky was required to produce were "each and every gift 
including, but not limited to, any and all dresses, accessories, and jewelry, 
and/or hat pins given to you by, or on behalf of, Defendant Clinton," as well as 
"[e]very document constituting or containing communications between you and 
Defendant Clinton, including letters, cards, notes, memoranda, and all telephone 
records."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_798_"><SUP>(798)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that, after being served with the subpoena, she "burst 
into tears," and then telephoned Mr. Jordan from a pay phone at the Pentagon.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_799_"><SUP>(799)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Jordan confirmed Ms. Lewinsky's account; he said he tried to reassure Ms. 
Lewinsky: "[C]ome and talk to me and I will see what I can do about finding you 
counsel."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_800_"><SUP>(800)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to records maintained by Mr. Jordan's law firm, Ms. Lewinsky 
arrived at his office at 4:47 p.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_801_"><SUP>(801)</SUP></A> 
White House phone records show that, at 4:57 p.m., the President telephoned Mr. 
Jordan; the two men spoke from 5:01 p.m. to 5:05 p.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_802_"><SUP>(802)</SUP></A> At 
5:06 p.m., Mr. Jordan placed a two-minute call to a Washington, D.C., attorney 
named Francis Carter.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_803_"><SUP>(803)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan gave somewhat different accounts of their meeting 
that day. According to Ms. Lewinsky, shortly after her arrival, Mr. Jordan 
received a phone call, and she stepped out of his office. A few minutes later, 
Ms. Lewinsky was invited back in, and Mr. Jordan called Mr. Carter.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_804_"><SUP>(804)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr. Jordan testified that he spoke to the President before Ms. Lewinsky ever 
entered his office.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_805_"><SUP>(805)</SUP></A> He 
told the President: "Monica Lewinsky called me up. She's upset. She's gotten a 
subpoena. She is coming to see me about this subpoena. I'm confident that she 
needs a lawyer, and I will try to get her a lawyer."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_806_"><SUP>(806)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Jordan told the President that the lawyer he had in mind was Francis 
Carter.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_807_"><SUP>(807)</SUP></A> 
According to Mr. Jordan, the President asked him: "You think he's a good 
lawyer?" Mr. Jordan responded that he was.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_808_"><SUP>(808)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Jordan testified that informing the President of Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena 
"was the purpose of [his] call."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_809_"><SUP>(809)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Mr. Jordan, when Ms. Lewinsky entered his office, "[H]er 
emotional state was obviously one of dishevelment and she was quite upset. She 
was crying. She was -- she was highly emotional, to say the least."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_810_"><SUP>(810)</SUP></A> 
She showed him the subpoena as soon as she entered.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_811_"><SUP>(811)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky also testified that she discussed the subpoena with Mr. 
Jordan.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_812_"><SUP>(812)</SUP></A> 
She told him that she found the specific reference to a hat pin alarming -- how 
could the Jones's attorneys have known about it?<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_813_"><SUP>(813)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Jordan told her it was "a standard subpoena."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_814_"><SUP>(814)</SUP></A> 
When he indicated to Ms. Lewinsky that he would be seeing the President that 
night, Ms. Lewinsky told him "to please make sure that he told the President" 
about her subpoena.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_815_"><SUP>(815)</SUP></A> 
<P>At some point, according to Mr. Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky asked him about the 
future of the Clintons' marriage.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_816_"><SUP>(816)</SUP></A> 
Because Ms. Lewinsky seemed "mesmerized" by President Clinton,<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_817_"><SUP>(817)</SUP></A> he 
"asked her directly had there been any sexual relationship between [her] and the 
President."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_818_"><SUP>(818)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Jordan explained, "You didn't have to be Einstein to know that that was a 
question that had to be asked by me at that particular time, because heretofore 
this discussion was about a job. The subpoena changed the circumstances."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_819_"><SUP>(819)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky said she had not had a sexual relationship with the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_820_"><SUP>(820)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified, however, that at this time she assumed that Mr. 
Jordan knew "with a wink and a nod that [she] was having a relationship with the 
President."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_821_"><SUP>(821)</SUP></A> 
She therefore interpreted Mr. Jordan's questions as "What are you going to say?" 
rather than "What are the [actual] answers . . .?"<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_822_"><SUP>(822)</SUP></A> 
When the meeting ended, she "asked [Mr. Jordan] if he would give the President a 
hug."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_823_"><SUP>(823)</SUP></A> 
<P>That evening, Mr. Jordan visited the President at the White House. According 
to Mr. Jordan, the two met alone in the Residence and talked for about ten 
minutes.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_824_"><SUP>(824)</SUP></A> He 
testified: 
<P>I told him that Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed, came to me with a 
subpoena. I told him that I was concerned by her fascination, her being taken 
with him. I told him how emotional she was about having gotten the subpoena. I 
told him what she said to me about whether or not he was going to leave the 
First Lady at the end of the term.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_825_"><SUP>(825)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Mr. Jordan asked the President "[t]he one question that I wanted answered."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_826_"><SUP>(826)</SUP></A> 
That question was, "Mr. President, have you had sexual relations with Monica 
Lewinsky?" The President told Mr. Jordan, "No, never."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_827_"><SUP>(827)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr. Jordan told the President: "I'm trying to help her get a job and I'm 
going to continue to do that. I'm going to get her counsel and I'm going to try 
to be helpful to her as much as I possibly can, both with the lawyer, and I've 
already done what I could about the job, and I think you ought to know that."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_828_"><SUP>(828)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Jordan testified: "He thanked me for telling him. Thanked me for my efforts 
to get her a job and thanked me for getting her a lawyer."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_829_"><SUP>(829)</SUP></A> 
<P>In his grand jury testimony, the President recalled that he met with Mr. 
Jordan on December 19; however, he testified that his memory of that meeting was 
somewhat vague: 
<P>I do not remember exactly what the nature of the conversation was. I do 
remember that I told him that there was no sexual relationship between me and 
Monica Lewinsky, which was true. And that -- then all I remember for the rest is 
that he said he had referred her to a lawyer, and I believe it was Mr. Carter.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_830_"><SUP>(830)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Asked whether he recalled that Mr. Jordan told him that Ms. Lewinsky appeared 
fixated on him and hoped that he would leave Mrs. Clinton, the President 
testified: "I recall him saying he thought that she was upset with -- somewhat 
fixated on me, that she acknowledged that she was not having a sexual 
relationship with me, and that she did not want to be [brought] into that 
<U>Jones</U> lawsuit."<A

11:00 a.m. on Monday, December 22.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_832_"><SUP>(832)</SUP></A> On 
that morning, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she called Mr. Jordan and asked to meet 
before they went to Mr. Carter's office.<A

She testified: "I was a little concerned. I thought maybe [Mr. Jordan] didn't 
really understand . . . what it was that was happening here with me being 
subpoenaed and what this really meant."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_834_"><SUP>(834)</SUP></A> 
She also wanted to find out whether he had in fact told the President of her 
subpoena. Mr. Jordan said that he had.<A

Ms. Lewinsky also told Mr. Jordan that she was worried that someone might have 
been eavesdropping on her telephone conversations with the President.<A

When Mr. Jordan asked why she thought that would be of concern, Ms. Lewinsky 
said, "Well, we've had phone sex."<A

<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that she brought some of her gifts from the President,

gifts that the President had given her.<A

Mr. Jordan, in contrast, testified that Ms. Lewinsky never showed him any gifts

<P>Mr. Carter and Ms. Lewinsky then met for approximately an hour.<A

said that he would try to persuade Paula Jones's attorneys not to depose her.<A

Ms. Lewinsky testified that she suggested filing an affidavit to avert a

href="6narrit.htm#N_846_"><SUP>(846)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she asked Mr. Carter to get in touch with the

obtain information about President Clinton's sexual relationships with any woman 
other than his wife. On December 11, 1997, the judge overseeing the <U>Jones</U> 
case, Susan Webber Wright, ruled that the President had to answer a written 
interrogatory naming every state and federal employee since 1986 with whom he 
had sexual relations or with whom he had proposed to have sexual relations. On 
December 23, 1997, the President answered the interrogatory: "None."<A

<P>A day or two after Christmas, Ms. Lewinsky called Ms. Currie and told her 
that the President had mentioned that he had presents for her.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_853_"><SUP>(853)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie called back and told her to come to the White House at 8:30 a.m. on 
Sunday, December 28.<A

<P>That morning, Ms. Lewinsky met with the President in the Oval Office. WAVES

entered the White House at 8:16 a.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_855_"><SUP>(855)</SUP></A> 
<P>After she arrived at the Oval Office, she, the President, and Ms. Currie 
played with Buddy, the President's dog, and chatted. Then, the President took 
her to the study and gave her several Christmas presents: a marble bear's head, 
a Rockettes blanket, a Black Dog stuffed animal, a small box of chocolates, a 
pair of joke sunglasses, and a pin with a New York skyline on it.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_856_"><SUP>(856)</SUP></A>

"passionate" and "physically intimate" kiss.<A

<P>Ms. Lewinsky and the President also talked about the <U>Jones</U> case.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_858_"><SUP>(858)</SUP></A> In 
Ms. Lewinsky's account, she asked the President "how he thought [she] got put on 
the witness list."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_859_"><SUP>(859)</SUP></A> He 
speculated that Linda Tripp or one of the uniformed Secret Service officers had 
told the Jones attorneys about her.<A

When Ms. Lewinsky mentioned her anxiety about the subpoena's reference to a hat 
pin, he said "that sort of bothered [him], too."<A

asked whether she had told anyone about the hat pin, and she assured him that 
she had not.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_862_"><SUP>(862)</SUP></A> 
<P>At some point in the conversation, Ms. Lewinsky told the President, "[M]aybe 
I should put the gifts away outside my house somewhere or give them to someone, 
maybe Betty."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_863_"><SUP>(863)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky recalled that the President responded either "I don't know" or "Let 
me think about that."<A

<P>When Ms. Lewinsky was asked whether she thought it odd for the President to 
give her gifts under the circumstances (with a subpoena requiring the production 
of all his gifts), she testified that she did not think of it at the time, but 
she did note some hesitancy on the President's part: 
<P>[H]e had hesitated very briefly right before I left that day in kind of 
packaging . . . all my stuff back up . . . I don't think he said anything that 
indicated this to me, but I thought to myself, "I wonder if he's thinking he 
shouldn't give these to me to take out." But he did.<A

her."<A

The deposition occurred three weeks after this December 28 meeting with Ms.

about her testimony, or about the prospect that she might have to give 
testimony. And she, she talked to me about that."<A

maintained, however, that they did not discuss Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena: "[S]he 
was upset. She -- well, she -- we -- she didn't -- we didn't talk about a 
subpoena. But she was upset."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_868_"><SUP>(868)</SUP></A> In 
the President's recollection, Ms. Lewinsky said she knew nothing about sexual 
harassment; why did she have to testify? According to the President, "I 
explained to her that it was a political lawsuit. They wanted to get whatever 
they could under oath that was damaging to me."<A

<P>Ms. Lewinsky's friend, Catherine Allday Davis, testified about a conversation 
with Ms. Lewinsky on January 3, 1998. Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Davis that she had 
met with the President and discussed the <U>Jones</U> case a few days earlier. 
Ms. Davis testified that Ms. Lewinsky and the President had "noted [that] there

<P><A name=L112><STRONG>E. December 28: Concealment of Gifts</STRONG> 
<P>In the afternoon of December 28, a few hours after Ms. Lewinsky's White House 
visit, Ms. Currie drove to Ms. Lewinsky's Watergate apartment and collected a 
box containing the President's gifts. Ms. Currie then took the box home and hid 
it under her bed. Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie, and the President were all 
questioned as to why Ms. Currie retrieved the box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky. 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, the transfer originated in a phone call from Ms. 
Currie that afternoon. Ms. Lewinsky testified that Ms. Currie said, "I 
understand you have something to give me," or, "The President said you have 
something to give me."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_871_"><SUP>(871)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky understood that Ms. Currie was alluding to the gifts.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_872_"><SUP>(872)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie said that she would stop by Ms. Lewinsky's apartment and pick up the 
items.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_873_"><SUP>(873)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky testified that she put many, but not all, of her gifts from the 
President into a box. Ms. Currie drove by her apartment and picked it up.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_874_"><SUP>(874)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky was concerned because the gifts were under subpoena; she did not 
throw them away, however, because "they meant a lot to [her]."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_875_"><SUP>(875)</SUP></A> 
The reason she gave the gifts to Ms. Currie, and not to one of her friends or 
her mother, was "a little bit of an assurance to the President . . . that 
everything was okay."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_876_"><SUP>(876)</SUP></A> 
She felt that, because the gifts were with Ms. Currie, they were within the 
President's control: "Not that [the gifts] were going to be in his possession, 
but that he would understand whatever it was I gave to Betty and that that might 
make him feel a little bit better."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_877_"><SUP>(877)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky's account of the events of December 28 in her sworn statement of 
February 1, 1998, corroborates her later grand jury testimony: 
<P>"Ms. L . . . asked if she should put away (outside her home) the gifts he had 
given her or, maybe, give them to someone else. Ms. Currie called Ms. L later 
that afternoon as said that the Pres. had told her Ms. L. wanted her to hold 
onto something for her. Ms. L boxed up most of the gifts she had received and 
gave them to Ms. Currie. It is unknown if Ms. Currie knew the contents of the 
box."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_878_"><SUP>(878)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Currie's testimony was somewhat at odds with Ms. Lewinsky's. Though her 
overall recollection was hazy, Ms. Currie believed that Ms. Lewinsky had called 
her and raised the idea of the gifts transfer.<A

Ms. Currie was asked about the President's involvement in the transfer:

said that he had no knowledge that Ms. Currie had held those items "until that

divulged what she knew.<A

Ms. Lewinsky said that Ms. Tripp might have seen some notes in her apartment. 
Mr. Jordan asked: "Notes from the President to you?" Ms. Lewinsky responded: 
"No, notes from me to the President." According to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan 
said: "Go home and make sure they're not there." Ms. Lewinsky testified that she

<P>On January 5, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky's attorney, Francis Carter, drafted an 
affidavit for Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky in an attempt to avert her deposition. She spoke 
with the President that evening. On January 6, Ms. Lewinsky talked to Mr. Jordan 
about the affidavit, which denied any sexual relations between her and the 
President. On January 7, Ms. Lewinsky signed the affidavit. On January 8, she 
interviewed for a job in New York City. After the interview went poorly, Mr. 
Jordan placed a phone call to the company's chairman on her behalf, and Ms. 
Lewinsky was given a second interview. The following week, after 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky told Ms.&nbsp;Currie that she would need a reference from the 
White House, the President asked Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles to arrange one.

<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that Mr. Carter described what a deposition was like

The questions that most concerned her related to the circumstances of her

that she needed to speak to the President about an important matter.<A

Specifically, Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Currie she was anxious about something she 
needed to sign.<A

<P>A few hours later, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President returned her 
call.<A

She mentioned an affidavit she would be signing and asked if he wanted to see 
it. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President responded that he did not, as he 
had already seen about fifteen others.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_906_"><SUP>(906)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky testified that she told the President that she was troubled by 
potential questions about her transfer from the White House to the Pentagon. She 
was concerned that "people at the White House who didn't like [her]" might 
contradict her and "get [her] in trouble."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_907_"><SUP>(907)</SUP></A> 
The President, according to Ms. Lewinsky, advised her: "[Y]ou could always say 
that the people in Legislative Affairs got it [the Pentagon job] for you or 
helped you get it."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_908_"><SUP>(908)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President acknowledged in the grand jury that he was aware that Ms. 
Lewinsky had signed an affidavit in early January, but had no specific 
recollection of a conversation with her in that time period.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_909_"><SUP>(909)</SUP></A> He 
testified that he did not recall telling Ms. Lewinsky that she could say, if 
asked, that persons in the Legislative Affairs Office of the White House had 
helped her obtain the job at the Pentagon.<A

<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President also briefly discussed an

book, she enclosed a letter telling the President that she wanted to have sexual 
intercourse with him at least once.<A

their phone conversation, Ms. Lewinsky told the President, "I shouldn't have 
written some of those things in the note."<A

She testified that the President agreed.<A

<P>Although the President had testified in the <U>Jones</U> case that any 
personal messages from Ms. Lewinsky to him had been "unremarkable," he told the 
grand jury that he had received "quite affectionate" messages from Ms. Lewinsky, 
even after their intimate relationship ended.<A

The President testified that he cautioned Ms. Lewinsky about such messages: "I 
remember telling her she should be careful what she wrote, because a lot of it 
was clearly inappropriate and would be embarrassing if somebody else read it. I 
don't remember when I said that. I don't remember whether it was in '96 or when 
it was."<A

Mr. Carter's office and picked up a draft of the affidavit.<A

Later that day, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she and Mr. Jordan discussed the 
draft by telephone.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_918_"><SUP>(918)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky testified that having Mr. Jordan review the affidavit was like 
getting it "blessed" by the President.<A

Ms. Lewinsky testified that she told Mr. Jordan that she was worried about a 
sentence that implied that she had been alone with the President and thus might 
incline Paula Jones's attorneys to question her.<A

She eventually deleted it.<A

<P>In addition, Paragraph 8 of the draft affidavit provided in part: 
<P>I have never had a sexual relationship with the President. . . . The 
occasions that I saw the President, <U>with crowds of other people</U>, after I 
left my employment at the White House in April, 1996 related to official 
receptions, formal functions or events related to the U.S. Department of 
Defense, where I was working at the time.<A

<P>Deeming the reference to "crowds" "too far out of the realm of 
possibility,"<A

the end of this paragraph: "There were other people present on all of these 
occasions."<A

She discussed this proposed sentence, as well as her general anxiety about 
Paragraph 8, with Mr. Jordan.<A

but maintained that he told her to speak with her attorney.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_927_"><SUP>(927)</SUP></A> 
<P>Phone records for January 6 show that Mr. Jordan had a number of contacts 
with Ms. Lewinsky, the President, and Mr. Carter. Less than thirty minutes after 
Mr. Jordan spoke by phone to Ms. Lewinsky, he talked with the President for 
thirteen minutes. Immediately after this call, at 4:33 p.m., Mr.&nbsp;Jordan 
called Mr. Carter. Less than an hour later, Mr. Jordan placed a four-minute call 
to the main White House number. Over the course of the day, Mr. Jordan called a 
White House number twice, Ms. Lewinsky three times, and Mr. Carter four times.<A

and the next "likely" related to Ms. Lewinsky and his litigation strategy for 
her.<A

Atty Jordan."<A

<P>When questioned in the grand jury, Mr. Jordan testified that he could not 
specifically remember the January 6 calls. He said he "assumed" that he talked 
with Ms. Lewinsky about her job search, and he believed that he called Mr. 
Carter to see "how he was dealing with this highly emotional lady."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_931_"><SUP>(931)</SUP></A> He 
said that he might have talked with the President about Ms. Lewinsky, but he

She signed the affidavit; however, she acknowledged in the grand jury that

Mr. Carter indicated to her that he "intend[ed] to hold onto this until after I

Over the course of the day, Mr. Jordan placed three calls of significant 
duration to the White House.<A

testified: "I knew the President was concerned about the affidavit and whether 
it was signed or not."<A

When asked whether the President understood that the affidavit denied a sexual 
relationship, Mr. Jordan testified: "I think that's a reasonable assumption."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_939_"><SUP>(939)</SUP></A> 
According to Mr. Jordan, when he informed the President that Ms. Lewinsky had 
signed the affidavit, the President said, "Fine, good."<A

<P>I knew he met with her. I think Betty suggested that he meet with her. 
Anyway, he met with her. I, I thought that he talked to her about something 
else. I didn't know that -- I thought he had given her some advice about her

The President defended his deposition testimony by stating: <BR wp="br1"><BR

believe the meetings he had were meetings about her moving to New York and 
getting a job. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">

she had gotten a subpoena. I'm not sure I know whether she did that in a meeting 
or a phone call. And I was not, I was not focused on that. I know that, I know 
Vernon helped her get a lawyer, Mr. Carter. And I, I believe that he did it 
after she had called him, but I'm not sure. But I knew that the main source of

Assistant to the Chairman at MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings, Inc. (MFH).<A

told her that he would pass on her resume to Revlon, an MFH company.<A

Mr. Jordan told the grand jury with respect to Mr. Perelman, one "[c]an't get 
any higher -- or any richer."<A

Asked why he chose to call Mr. Perelman, Mr. Jordan responded: "I have spent a 
good part of my life learning institutions and people, and, in that process, I 
have learned how to make things happen. And the call to Ronald Perelman was a 
call to make things happen, if they could happen."<A

think is terrific," and said that he wanted "to make sure somebody takes a look 
at her."<A

Mr. Perelman testified that, in the roughly twelve years that Mr. Jordan had 
been on Revlon's Board of Directors, he did not recall Mr. Jordan ever calling

Mr. Hilley responded that, because he did not know Ms. Lewinsky personally, he 
would have his office write a recommendation.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_974_"><SUP>(974)</SUP></A> It 
would be a generic letter, simply confirming the dates of employment, because of 
the less than favorable circumstances surrounding Ms. Lewinsky's departure from 
the White House.<A

<P>Ms. Lewinsky testified that Ms. Currie called later that day and told her

11:17 a.m. the next day, Wednesday, January 14, Ms. Lewinsky faxed her 
acceptance to Revlon and listed John Hilley and her Defense Department 
supervisor as references.<A

<P>The President was asked in the grand jury whether he ever spoke to Mr. Bowles 
about obtaining a reference from Mr. Hilley for Ms. Lewinsky. He testified that 
he did, at Ms. Lewinsky's request, although he thought he had done so earlier 
than January 13 or 14.<A

<P><A name=L125><STRONG>I. January 13: Final Jordan Meeting</STRONG> 
<P>According to Ms. Lewinsky, on Tuesday, January 13, she stopped by Mr. 
Jordan's office to drop off some thank-you gifts for helping her find a job. Ms. 
Lewinsky offered to show him a copy of her signed affidavit in the <U>Jones</U>

<STRONG>and Talking Points</STRONG> 
<P>In a face-to-face conversation on January 13, Ms. Lewinsky told Linda Tripp: 
"This is what my lawyer taught me. You really don't -- you don't very often say 
'no' unless you really need to. The best is, 'Well, not that I recall, not that 
I really remember. Might have, but I don't really remember.'"<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_980_"><SUP>(980)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky said that, if asked in a deposition, "Were you ever alone with the 
President?" she could say, "Um, it's possible I may have taken a letter on the 
weekend, but, you know -- I might have, but I don't really. . . ."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_981_"><SUP>(981)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp then discussed the situation: 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky: I don't think the way that man thinks, I don't think he thinks 
of lying under oath. . . . <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Tripp: Yes, he is because he's the one who said, "Deny, deny, deny." Of 
course he knows. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky: Right. But it's -- hard to explain this. It's like -- (sigh) 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Tripp: You know what I mean. I mean, I don't know -- do I think he is 
consciously -- <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Lewinsky: If-- if -- if I said, if somebody said to him, "Is Monica lying 
under oath," he would say yes. But when he on his own thinks about it, he 
doesn't think about it in those terms. Okay? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Tripp: Probably. 
<P>Ms. Lewinsky: Okay? He thinks of it as, "We're safe. We're being smart." 
Okay? "We're being smart, we're being safe, it's good for everybody."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_982_"><SUP>(982)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>On January 14, Ms. Lewinsky gave Ms. Tripp a three-page document regarding 
"points to make in [Ms. Tripp's] affidavit."<A

Ms. Lewinsky testified that she wrote the document herself, although some of the

<P>In the grand jury, Betty Currie testified that on Thursday, January 15, 1998, 
she received a telephone call from Michael Isikoff of <U>Newsweek</U>, who 
inquired about courier receipts reflecting items sent by Ms. Lewinsky to the 
White House.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_985_"><SUP>(985)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Currie called Mr. Jordan and asked for guidance in responding to Mr. 
Isikoff's inquiry because, in her words, she had a "comfort level with 
Vernon."<A

After Ms. Currie arranged to meet with Mr. Jordan at his office,<A

Ms. Lewinsky drove her there.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_988_"><SUP>(988)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr. Jordan confirmed in the grand jury that Ms. Currie expressed concern 
about a call from Mr. Isikoff.<A

invited her to his office but advised her to "talk to Mike McCurry and Bruce 
Lindsey . . . because I cannot give you that advice."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_990_"><SUP>(990)</SUP></A> 
<P>In a recorded conversation that day, January 15, Ms. Lewinsky encouraged Ms. 
Tripp not to disclose her (Lewinsky's) relationship with the President. Ms. 
Lewinsky tried to persuade Ms. Tripp to lie by telling her that others planned 
to lie: "I'm not concerned all that much anymore because I'm not going to get in 
trouble because you know what? The story I've signed . . . under oath is what 
someone else is saying under oath." When Ms. Tripp asked, "Who?" Ms. Lewinsky 
responded: "He will," referring to the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_991_"><SUP>(991)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Lewinsky stated that she did not think the President would "slip up" at his 
deposition because she was not a "big issue" like Gennifer Flowers and Paula 
Jones. In contrast, she regarded herself as nothing more than "rumor and 
innuendo."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_992_"><SUP>(992)</SUP></A> 
<P>One of Ms. Lewinsky's friends, Natalie Ungvari, testified that, when Ms. 
Lewinsky was implicated in the <U>Jones</U> case, "it seemed to me that Monica 
was just confident everybody would say the right thing, that everything would be 
orchestrated to come out a secret."<A

President Clinton objected to the scope of this request, but, notwithstanding 
his objection, he stated that he did not have any responsive documents. 
<P>Also on January 15, Mr. Carter drafted a motion to quash the subpoena issued 
by Paula Jones's attorneys to Ms. Lewinsky. Attached to the motion was Ms. 
Lewinsky's signed affidavit.<A

the request of Katherine Sexton, one of the President's personal attorneys, Mr. 
Carter faxed a copy of the affidavit to her law offices. Mr. Carter testified 
that he asked Ms. Sexton why she needed the affidavit that day: 
<P>I said, "Well, Katie, you're going to get it tomorrow because I'm filing it, 
and it's going to be attached as an exhibit to the motion." She said, "Well, but 
you've already provided it to the other side, so can I get a copy" -- words to 
that effect. I said, "I have no problem." And so I faxed it to her.<A

<P>The President was asked a number of questions about Ms. Lewinsky during his

President denied having a sexual affair or sexual relations with her. That 
evening, the President called Ms.&nbsp;Currie and asked her to meet him the 
following day to discuss Ms. Lewinsky. After allegations that the President had 
an affair with a White House intern became public, the President emphatically 
denied the reports to aides and to the American public.

deposition in the <U>Jones</U> case.<A

Judge Susan Webber Wright traveled from Little Rock, Arkansas, to preside at the 
deposition in Washington, D.C.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1000_"><SUP>(1000)</SUP></A> 
<P>Prior to any questions, Judge Wright reminded the parties about her standing 
Protective Order. She specifically stated: "[I]f anyone reveals anything 
whatsoever about this deposition, 
<P>. . . it will be in violation of the Protective Order. This includes the 
questions that were asked, . . . You may acknowledge that [the deposition] took 
place, but that is it."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1001_"><SUP>(1001)</SUP></A> 
Judge Wright accepted the following definition of the term "sexual relations:" 
<P>For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in "sexual relations" 
when the person knowingly engages in or causes . . . contact with the genitalia, 
anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to 
arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person . . . . "Contact" means 
intentional touching, either directly or through clothing.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1002_"><SUP>(1002)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>After the President had answered a few questions about Ms. Lewinsky, his 
attorney, Robert Bennett, urged Judge Wright to limit further inquiries. Mr. 
Bennett stated that Ms. Lewinsky had executed an affidavit "saying that there is 
absolutely no sex of any kind of any manner, shape or form, with President 
Clinton."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1003_"><SUP>(1003)</SUP></A> 
When Judge Wright cautioned Mr. Bennett not to make remarks that "could be 
arguably coaching the witness," Mr. Bennett represented to Judge Wright: "In 
preparation of the witness for this deposition, the witness is fully aware of 
Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, so I have not told him a single thing he doesn't know 
. . . ."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1004_"><SUP>(1004)</SUP></A> 
President Clinton, who was presentwhen Mr. Bennett made his objection, did not 
contradict his attorney's comment. Rejecting Mr. Bennett's argument, Judge 
Wright permitted the questioning about Ms. Lewinsky to continue.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1005_"><SUP>(1005)</SUP></A> 
<P>Over the course of extensive questioning, the President testified that he had 
seen Ms. Lewinsky "on two or three occasions" during the government shutdown in 
the fall of 1995, including one occasion when she brought pizza to him, and one 
or two other occasions when she delivered documents to him.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1006_"><SUP>(1006)</SUP></A> 
He could not recall whether he had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky on such 
occasions, although he acknowledged that it was possible.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1007_"><SUP>(1007)</SUP></A> 
The President further testified that he could not remember the subject of any 
conversations with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1008_"><SUP>(1008)</SUP></A> 
<P>President Clinton recalled that he received only a couple of unremarkable 
personal messages from Ms. Lewinsky, and he could not recall ever having 
received a cassette tape from her.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1009_"><SUP>(1009)</SUP></A> 
He received presents from her "[o]nce or twice" -- a book or two and a tie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1010_"><SUP>(1010)</SUP></A> 
The President originally testified that he could not recall any gifts he might 
have given her; later in the deposition, however, he remembered that some 
merchandise he had purchased from a Martha's Vineyard restaurant might have 
reached her through Ms. Currie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1011_"><SUP>(1011)</SUP></A> 
The President stated that he might have given Ms. Lewinsky a hat pin, though he 
could not recall for certain.<A

<P>The President testified that his last conversation with Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky had 
been before Christmas, when she had visited the White House to see Ms. Currie. 
The President stated: "I stuck my head out, said hello to her."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1013_"><SUP>(1013)</SUP></A> 
He said it was also possible that, during that encounter, he had joked with 
Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky that the plaintiff's attorneys were going to subpoena "every 
woman I ever talked to" and Ms. Lewinsky "would qualify."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1014_"><SUP>(1014)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President testified that he was unaware that Mr. Jordan had talked with

to testify at a deposition.<A

everyone else in the room, that this case is subject to a Protective Order 
regarding all discovery, . . . and . . . all parties present, including . . . 
the witness are not to say anything whatsoever about the questions they were

asked about Monica Lewinsky.<A

Ms. Currie acknowledged that, "It's rare for [the President] to ask me to come

asked questions about Monica Lewinsky.<A

<P>Ms. Currie testified that she did, in fact, agree with the President when he 
said, "You were always there when she was there, right?"<A

Before the grand jury, however, Ms. Currie acknowledged the possibility that Ms. 
Lewinsky could have visited the President when she was not at the White House.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1033_"><SUP>(1033)</SUP></A> 
<P>With respect to whether the President was "never really alone" with Ms.

President and Ms. Lewinsky were either in the Oval Office or in the study 
without anyone else present.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1034_"><SUP>(1034)</SUP></A> 
<P>Ms. Currie explained that she did not consider the President and Ms. Lewinsky 
to be "alone" on such occasions because she was at her desk outside the Oval 
Office; accordingly, they were all together in the same "general area."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1035_"><SUP>(1035)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie testified that "the President, for all intents and purposes, is never 
alone. There's always somebody around him."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1036_"><SUP>(1036)</SUP></A> 
<P>As to whether Ms. Lewinsky "came on" to him, Ms. Currie testified that she 
"would have no reason to know" whether Ms. Lewinsky ever "came on" to the 
President because Ms. Currie was not present all the time.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1037_"><SUP>(1037)</SUP></A> 
Finally, as to whether she "could see and hear everything," Ms. Currie testified 
that she should not have agreed with the President.<A

She testified that when the President and Ms. Lewinsky were alone together in 
the study, while Ms. Currie was at her desk, she could "hear nothing."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1039_"><SUP>(1039)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President also made the following statement during their January 18, 1998

but I told her I couldn't do that."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1040_"><SUP>(1040)</SUP></A> 
<P>When the President was questioned about this meeting with Ms. Currie in the

he was "trying to get Betty Currie to say something that was untruthful."<A

Rather, the President testified that he asked a "series of questions" in an 
effort to quickly "refresh [his] memory."<A

The President explained: "I wanted to establish . . . that Betty was there at 
all other times in the complex, and I wanted to know what Betty's memory was 
about what she heard, what she could hear . . . . [a]nd I was trying to figure 
[it] out . . . in a hurry because I knew something was up."<A

<P>In his grand jury testimony, the President acknowledged that, "in fairness," 
Ms. Currie "may have felt some ambivalence about how to react" to his 
statements.<A

The President maintained that he was trying to establish that Ms. Currie was 
"always there," and could see and hear everything.<A

"[I] did what people do when they do the wrong thing. I tried to do it where 
nobody else was looking at it."<A

intended the term "Oval Office" to include the entire Oval Office complex.<A

The President further explained, "I was talking about 1997. I was never, ever 
trying to get Betty Currie to claim that on the occasions when Monica Lewinsky 
was there when she wasn't anywhere around, that she was."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1049_"><SUP>(1049)</SUP></A> 
When asked whether he restricted his remarks to the year 1997, the President

<P>When questioned about his statement to Ms. Currie, "you 
<P>could see and hear everything," the President responded: 
<P>My memory of that was that, that she had the ability to hear what was going 
on if she came in the Oval Office from her office. And a lot of times, you know, 
when I was in the Oval Office, she just had the door open to her office. Then 
there was -- the door was never completely closed to the hall. So, I think there 
was -- I'm not entirely sure what I meant by that, but I could have meant that 
she generally would be able to hear conversations, even if she couldn't see 
them. And I think that's what I meant.<A

Later, Ms. Lewinsky's attorney, Frank Carter, called Mr. Jordan and told him 
that Ms. Lewinsky had obtained new counsel, William Ginsburg and Nathaniel 
Speights.<A

Mr. Jordan passed this information on to the President that evening in a

<P><A name=L134><STRONG>D. January 20-22: Lewinsky Story Breaks</STRONG> 
<P>After the publication of an article alleging a sexual relationship with Ms. 
Lewinsky, President Clinton conferred with his attorneys and issued a number of 
denials to his aides and to the American public. 
<P><A name=L135><STRONG>1. "Clinton Accused"</STRONG> 
<P>On Wednesday, January 21, 1998, the <U>Washington Post</U> published a story 
entitled "Clinton Accused of Urging Aide to Lie; Starr Probes Whether President 
Told Woman to Deny Alleged Affair to Jones's Lawyers<EM>."</EM><A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1063_"><SUP>(1063)</SUP></A> 
The White House learned the essentials of the <U>Post</U> story on the night of 
January 20, 1998.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1064_"><SUP>(1064)</SUP></A> 
<P>President Clinton placed a number of phone calls that night and the following 
morning.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1065_"><SUP>(1065)</SUP></A> 
From 12:08 a.m. to 12:39 a.m., he spoke with his personal attorney, Robert 
Bennett. Mr. Bennett would be quoted in the <U>Post</U> article as saying, "The 
President adamantly denies he ever had a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and she 
has confirmed the truth of that."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1066_"><SUP>(1066)</SUP></A> 
He added: "This story seems ridiculous and I frankly smell a rat."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1067_"><SUP>(1067)</SUP></A> 
<P>Immediately after his call to Mr. Bennett, President Clinton called Deputy 
White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey; they spoke for about half an hour, until 1:10 
a.m.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1068_"><SUP>(1068)</SUP></A> 
<P>At 1:16 a.m., the President called Ms. Currie at home and spoke to her for 20 
minutes. Ms. Currie testified that the President was concerned that her name was 
mentioned in the <U>Post</U> article.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1069_"><SUP>(1069)</SUP></A> 
Soon after this call, the President called Mr. Lindsey.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1070_"><SUP>(1070)</SUP></A> 
<P>A few hours later, at approximately 6:30 a.m., the President called Mr. 
Jordan in New York City to tell him, according to Mr. Jordan, that the 
<U>Post</U> story was untrue.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1071_"><SUP>(1071)</SUP></A> 
From 7:14 a.m. to 7:22&nbsp;a.m., the President spoke again with Mr. Lindsey.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1072_"><SUP>(1072)</SUP></A> 
<P>Responding to the <U>Post</U> story that day, the White House issued a 
statement, personally approved by the President, declaring that he was "outraged 
by these allegations" and that "he has never had an improper relationship with 
this woman." White House spokesperson Mike McCurry said that the statement "was 
prepared by the Counsel's office, and I reviewed it with the President to make 
sure that it reflected what he wanted me to say . . . He looked at it, and he 
said fine. . . . It was prepared in consultation between the lawyers and the 
President. The Counsel's Office gave it to me. I wanted to, of course, verify 
that that's exactly what the President wanted me to say."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1073_"><SUP>(1073)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L136><STRONG>2. Denials to Aides</STRONG> 
<P>According to Mr. Lindsey, the remainder of the morning was spent in a series 
of meetings about the Lewinsky matter, including preparing the President for 
anticipated Lewinsky-related questions in three previously scheduled media 
interviews.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1074_"><SUP>(1074)</SUP></A> 
At these meetings, President Clinton denied the allegations to several of his 
top aides. 
<P>The President met with Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, along with his two 
deputies, John Podesta and Sylvia Matthews. According to Mr. Bowles, the 
President told them, "I want you to know I did not have sexual relationships 
with this woman, Monica Lewinsky. I did not ask anybody to lie. And when the 
facts come out, you'll understand."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1075_"><SUP>(1075)</SUP></A> 
The President made a similar denial that morning to Harold Ickes, his former 
Deputy Chief of Staff.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1076_"><SUP>(1076)</SUP></A> 
The President also discussed the matter with Ms. Currie for a second time.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1077_"><SUP>(1077)</SUP></A> 
According to Ms. Currie, the President called her into the Oval Office and gave 
a "sort of a recapitulation of what we had talked about on Sunday -- you know, 
'I was never alone with her' -- that sort of thing."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1078_"><SUP>(1078)</SUP></A> 
The President spoke with the same tone and demeanor that he used during his 
previous session with her.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1079_"><SUP>(1079)</SUP></A> 
Ms. Currie testified that the President may have mentioned that she might be 
asked about Ms.&nbsp;Lewinsky.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1080_"><SUP>(1080)</SUP></A> 
<P>Later that day, the President summoned Sidney Blumenthal to the Oval Office. 
They spoke for about 30 minutes.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1081_"><SUP>(1081)</SUP></A> 
The President said to Mr. Blumenthal, "I haven't done anything wrong."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1082_"><SUP>(1082)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Blumenthal testified that the President told him, "Monica Lewinsky came on 
to me and made a sexual demand on me." The President said that he "rebuffed 
her."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1083_"><SUP>(1083)</SUP></A> 
The President also told Mr. Blumenthal that Ms. Lewinsky had "threatened him. 
She said that she would tell people they'd had an affair, that she was known as 
the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it and if she had an affair or 
said she had an affair then she wouldn't be the stalker any more."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1084_"><SUP>(1084)</SUP></A> 
Mr.&nbsp;Blumenthal then asked the President whether he and Ms. Lewinsky were 
alone when she threatened him. The President responded, "Well, I was within 
eyesight or earshot of someone."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1085_"><SUP>(1085)</SUP></A> 
<P>According to Mr. Blumenthal, the President complained: "I feel like a 
character in a novel. I feel like somebody who is surrounded by an oppressive 
force that is creating a lie about me and I can't get the truth out. I feel like 
the character in the novel <U>Darkness at Noon</U>."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1086_"><SUP>(1086)</SUP></A> 
<P>Soon thereafter, in the course of a meeting about the progress of the 
President's State of the Union address, the President made a second denial of 
the allegations to Mr. Podesta.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1087_"><SUP>(1087)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Podesta testified: 
<P>[H]e said to me that he had never had sex with her, and that -- and that he 
never asked -- you know, he repeated the denial, but he was extremely explicit 
in saying he never had sex with her . . . . Well, I think he said -- he said 
that -- there was some spate of, you know, what sex acts were counted, and he 
said that he had never had sex with her in any way whatsoever -- that they had 
not had oral sex.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1088_"><SUP>(1088)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President was asked during his grand jury appearance whether he recalled 
denying a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to his senior aides and 
advisors, including Mr. Bowles, Mr. Podesta, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Ickes, and Mr. 
Jordan.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1089_"><SUP>(1089)</SUP></A> 
The President did not recall specific details but did remember the following: 
<P>I met with certain people, and [to] a few of them I said I didn't have sex 
with Monica Lewinsky, or I didn't have an affair with her or something like 
that. I had a very careful thing I said, and I tried not to say anything else . 
. . . I remember that I issued a number of denials to people that I thought 
needed to hear them, but I tried to be careful and to be accurate. <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>
<CENTER>* * *</CENTER><BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>And I believe, sir, that -- you'll have to ask them what they thought. But I 
was using those terms in the normal way people use them.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1090_"><SUP>(1090)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>The President testified that he had said "things that were true about this 
relationship. That I used -- in the language I used, I said, there's nothing 
going on between us. That was true.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1091_"><SUP>(1091)</SUP></A> 
I said I did not have sex with her as I defined it. That was true."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1092_"><SUP>(1092)</SUP></A> 
The President qualified this answer, however: "I said things that were true. 
They may have been misleading, and if they were I have to take responsibility 
for it, and I'm sorry."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1093_"><SUP>(1093)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L137><STRONG>3. Initial Denials to the American Public</STRONG> 
<P>On the afternoon of January 21, the President made his first of a series of 
previously scheduled media appearances. In an interview on National Public 
Radio's "All Things Considered," the following colloquy took place: 
<P>Q: Mr. President, . . . . [m]any Americans woke up to the news today that the 
Whitewater independent counsel is investigating an allegation that 
you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;encouraged a young woman to lie to lawyers in the 
Paula Jones civil suit. Is there any truth to that allegation? <BR wp="br1"><BR 
wp="br2">
<P>WJC: No, sir, there's not. It's just not true. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Q: Is there any truth to the allegation of an affair between you and the 
young woman? <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>WJC: No. That's not true either. . . . The charges are not true. And I 
haven't asked anybody to lie.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1094_"><SUP>(1094)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>That evening, the President appeared on the PBS program "The News Hour with 
Jim Lehrer." He was asked again whether the allegation of an affair with a White 
House intern was true. The President replied, "That is not true. That is not 
true. I did not ask anyone to tell anything other than the truth. There is no 
improper relationship. And I intend to cooperate with this inquiry. But that is 
not true." When asked to define what he meant by the term "improper 
relationship," the President answered, "Well, I think you know what it means. It 
means that there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship, 
or any other kind of improper relationship."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1095_"><SUP>(1095)</SUP></A> 
<P>The following morning, on January 22, 1998, the President again denied he had 
done anything improper. Speaking at a televised White House photo opportunity 
with Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the President stated: "[T]he 
allegations are false, and I would never ask anybody to do anything other than 
tell the truth. That is false."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1096_"><SUP>(1096)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President also gave an interview to <U>Roll Call</U> that day. He stated: 
"[T]he relationship was not improper, and I think that's important enough to 
say. . . . But let me answer -- it is not an improper relationship and I know 
what the word means. . . . The relationship was not sexual. And I know what you 
mean, and the answer is no."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1097_"><SUP>(1097)</SUP></A> 
<P>At each of these interviews, the President pledged he would cooperate fully 
with the investigation. On NPR, the President stated: "I have told people that I 
would cooperate in the investigation, and I expect to cooperate with it. I don't 
know any more about it, really, than you do. But I will cooperate. . . . I'm 
doing my best to cooperate with the investigation."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1098_"><SUP>(1098)</SUP></A> 
To Mr. Lehrer, he said: "[W]e are doing the best to cooperate here, but we don't 
know much yet. . . . I think it's important that we cooperate, I will cooperate, 
but I want to focus on the work at hand."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1099_"><SUP>(1099)</SUP></A> 
<P>In his photo opportunity with Mr. Arafat, the President stated: 
<P>[T]he American people have a right to get answers. We are working very hard 
to comply, get all the requests for information up here. And we will give you as 
many answers as we can, as soon as we can, at the appropriate time, consistent 
with our obligation to also cooperate with the investigations. And that's not a 
dodge; that's really what I've -- I've talked with our people. I want to do 
that. I'd like for you to have more rather than less, sooner rather than later. 
So we will work through it as quickly as we can and get all those questions out 
there to you."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1100_"><SUP>(1100)</SUP></A> 
<BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Finally, in his <U>Roll Call</U> interview, the President vowed: "I'm going 
to cooperate with this investigation. . . . And I'll cooperate."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1101_"><SUP>(1101)</SUP></A> 
<P><A name=L138><STRONG>4. "We Just Have To Win" </STRONG>
<P>Amidst the flurry of press activity on January 21, 1998, the President's 
former political consultant, Dick Morris, read the <U>Post</U> story and called 
the President.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1102_"><SUP>(1102)</SUP></A> 
According to Mr. Morris, he told the President, "You poor son of a bitch. I've 
just read what's going on."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1103_"><SUP>(1103)</SUP></A> 
The President responded, Mr. Morris recalled, "Oh, God. This is just awful. . . 
. I didn't do what they said I did, but I did do something. I mean, with this 
girl, I didn't do what they said, but I did . . . do something<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1104_"><SUP>(1104)</SUP></A>. 
. . . And I may have done enough so that I don't know if I can prove my 
innocence. . . . There may be gifts. I gave her gifts, . . . . [a]nd there may 
be messages on her phone answering machine."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1105_"><SUP>(1105)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr. Morris assured the President, "[t]here's a great capacity for forgiveness 
in this country and you should consider tapping into it."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1106_"><SUP>(1106)</SUP></A> 
The President said, "But what about the legal thing? You know, the legal thing? 
You know, Starr and perjury and all. . . . You know, ever since the election, 
I've tried to shut myself down. I've tried to shut my body down, sexually, I 
mean. . . . But sometimes I slipped up and with this girl I just slipped up."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1107_"><SUP>(1107)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr. Morris suggested that he take a poll on the voters' willingness to 
forgive confessed adultery. The President agreed.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1108_"><SUP>(1108)</SUP></A> 
<P>Mr. Morris telephoned the President later that evening with the poll results, 
which showed that the voters were "willing to forgive [the President] for 
adultery, but not for perjury or obstruction of justice[.]"<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1109_"><SUP>(1109)</SUP></A> 
When Mr. Morris explained that the poll results suggested that the President 
should not go public with a confession or explanation, he replied, "Well, we 
just have to win, then."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1110_"><SUP>(1110)</SUP></A> 
<P>The President had a follow-up conversation with Mr. Morris during the evening 
of January 22, 1998, when Mr. Morris was considering holding a press conference 
to "blast Monica Lewinsky 'out of the water.'"<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1111_"><SUP>(1111)</SUP></A> 
The President told Mr. Morris to "be careful". According to Mr. Morris, the 
President warned him not to "be too hard on [Ms. Lewinsky] because there's some 
slight chance that she may not be cooperating with Starr and we don't want to 
alienate her by anything we're going to put out."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1112_"><SUP>(1112)</SUP></A> 
<P>Meanwhile, in California, the President's good friend and Hollywood producer, 
Harry Thomason, had seen the President's interview with Jim Lehrer on 
televison.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1113_"><SUP>(1113)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Thomason, who had occasionally advised the President on matters relating to 
the media, traveled to Washington, D.C., and met with him the next day.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1114_"><SUP>(1114)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Thomason told the President that "the press seemed to be saying that [the 
President's comments were] weak" and that he, Mr. Thomason, "thought his 
response wasn't as strong as it could have been."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1115_"><SUP>(1115)</SUP></A> 
Mr. Thomason recommended that the President "should explain it so there's no 
doubt in anybody's mind that nothing happened."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1116_"><SUP>(1116)</SUP></A> 
The President agreed: "You know, you're right. I should be more forceful than 
that."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1117_"><SUP>(1117)</SUP></A> 
<P>In the ensuing days, the President, through his Cabinet, issued a number of 
firm denials. On January 23, 1998, the President started a Cabinet meeting by 
saying the allegations were untrue.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1118_"><SUP>(1118)</SUP></A> 
Afterward, several Cabinet members appeared outside the White House. Madeline 
Albright, Secretary of State, said: "I believe that the allegations are 
completely untrue." The others agreed. "I'll second that, definitely," Commerce 
Secretary William Daley said. Secretary of Education Richard Riley and Secretary 
of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala concurred.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1119_"><SUP>(1119)</SUP></A> 
<P>The next day, Ann Lewis, White House Communications Director, publicly 
announced that "those of us who have wanted to go out and speak on behalf of the 
president" had been given the green light by the President's legal team.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1120_"><SUP>(1120)</SUP></A> 
She reported that the President answered the allegations "directly" by denying 
any improper relationship. She believed that, in issuing his public denials, the 
President was not "splitting hairs, defining what is a sexual relationship, 
talking about 'is' rather than was.<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1121_"><SUP>(1121)</SUP></A> 
You know, I always thought, perhaps I was naive, since I've come to Washington, 
when you said a sexual relationship, everybody knew what that meant." Ms. Lewis 
expressly said that the term includes "oral sex."<A 
href="6narrit.htm#N_1122_"><SUP>(1122)</SUP></A> 
<P>* * * 
<P>On Monday, January 26, 1998, in remarks in the Roosevelt Room in the White 
House, President Clinton gave his last public statement for several months on 
the Lewinsky matter. At an event promoting after-school health care, the 
President denied the allegations in the strongest terms: "I want to say one 
thing to the American people. I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this 
again: I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never 
told anybody to lie, not a single time. Never. These allegations are false."<A

The negotiations in January and February 1998 (which produced the written

because of her perjurious <U>Jones</U> affidavit, her efforts to persuade Linda 
Tripp to commit perjury, her assertion in a recorded conversation that she had 
been brought up to regard lying as necessary, and her forgery of a letter while

sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the President testified that he could not 
recall many details of their encounters. He said he could not specifically 
remember whether he had ever been alone with Ms. Lewinsky, or any of their 
in-person conversations, or any notes or messages she had sent him, or an 
audiocassette she had sent him, or any specific gifts he had given her. Alone

their last conversation, the President referred to a December encounter when, he 
said, Ms. Lewinsky had been visiting his secretary and he had "stuck [his] head

Ms. Lewinsky on December 28, 1997, or a telephone conversation with her on

paragraphs of the definition that Judge Wright ruled inapplicable. Clinton 
1/17/98 Depo. at 21-22. The President testified that he considered the 
definition "rather strange," and at one point he spoke of "people being drawn 
into a lawsuit and being given definitions, and then a great effort to trick 
them in some way." Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 19, 22. He acknowledged, however, that 
the definition "was the one the Judge decided on and I was bound by it." Clinton

numbers include occasions when one or both of them had direct contact with the 
other's genitals, but not occasions when they merely kissed. On the timing of 
some of their sexual encounters, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is at odds with the 
President's. According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had three sexual 
encounters in 1995 (the President said he recalled none) and two sexual 
encounters in 1997 (not one, as the President testified). Lewinsky 8/6/98 GJ at 
27-28 &amp; Ex. ML-7; Lewinsky 8/26/98 Depo. at 6; Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 9-10. 
The President's account omits the two 1995 encounters when Ms. Lewinsky was an 
intern (as well as one 1995 encounter when she worked on the White House staff), 
and it treats the 1997 encounter that produced the semen-stained dress as a 
single aberration.

The other, T22, is a telephone conversation between Ms. Tripp and Ms. Lewinsky, 
recorded by Ms. Tripp. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>From these and other transcripts of recorded conversations, the OIC has 
redacted various brief, irrelevant, and gratuitous passages, mostly references 
to Ms. Lewinsky's family members. Most of these redactions are only a word or 
two long; others are somewhat longer. The tapes themselves have not been edited 
by the OIC, and the OIC will provide unredacted transcripts if the House of 
Representatives so requests. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Ms. Tripp produced to the OIC 27 tapes (four of which proved inaudible or 
blank) of her telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Tripp testified 
that she turned over the original recordings. She testified that she knew 
nothing about any duplications of the recordings, though others had access to or 
control over the tapes at times before they were turned over. According to a 
preliminary FBI examination, several of the 23 tapes containing audible 
conversations exhibit signs of duplication, and one tape exhibiting signs of 
duplication was produced by a recorder that was stopped and restarted during the 
recording process. These preliminary results raise questions about the 
reliability and authenticity of at least one recording, which in turn raise 
questions about the accuracy of Ms. Tripp's testimony regarding her handling of 
the tapes. The OIC is continuing to investigate this matter. This Referral does 
not quote or rely on any tapes that exhibit signs of duplication. For a fuller 
discussion, <U>see</U> Appendix, Tab I.

<P>A draft of Ms. Lewinsky's thank-you note (to "Dear Mr. P") was found in her 
apartment. It says in part: <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>All of my life, everyone has always said that I am a difficult person for 
whom to shop, and yet, <U>you</U> managed to choose two absolutely perfect 
presents! A little phrase (with only eight letters) like "thank you" simply 
cannot begin to express what I feel for what you have given me. Art &amp; poetry 
are gifts to my soul! <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>I just <U>love</U> the hat pin. It is vibrant, unique and a beautiful piece 
of art. My only hope is that I have a hat fit to adorn it (ahhh, I see another 
excuse to go shopping)! I know that I am bound to receive compliments on it. <BR 
wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>I have only read excerpts from "Leaves of Grass" before -- never in its 
entirety or in such a beautifully bound edition. Like Shakespeare, Whitman's 
writings are so timeless. I find solace in works from the past that remain 
profound and somehow always poignant. Whitman is so rich that one must read him 
like one tastes a fine wine or good cigar -- take it in, roll it in your mouth, 
and savor it! <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>I hope you know how very grateful I am for these gifts, especially your gift 
of friendship. I will treasure them all . . . always. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">

suggested language to use in her letters to them. At some point, Mr. Jordan 
remarked something about Ms. L. being a friend of the Pres. of the United 
States. Ms. L. responded that she never really saw him as "the President"; she 
spoke to him like a normal man and even got angry with him like a normal man. 
Mr. Jordan asked what Ms. L. got angry about. Ms. L. replied that the Pres. 
doesn't see or call her enough. Mr. Jordan said Ms. L. should take her 
frustrations out on him -- not the President." Lewinsky 2/1/98 Statement at 3-4.

the way the President phrased the inquiries made them sound like both questions

<P><A name=N_1031_>1031. </A>Currie 1/27/98 GJ at 74-75. Ms. Currie's testimony 
that the President wanted her to agree with his statements shifted somewhat 
between her first grand jury appearance and her last, which occurred five months 
later. On January 27, 1998, nine days after her conversation with the President, 
Ms. Currie testified that she understood from the President's questions that he 
wanted her to agree with him. Currie 1/27/98 GJ at 72-76. By July 22, 1998, 
however, Ms. Currie claimed that although the President stated "right?" at the 
end of the statements, Ms. Currie understood that she could agree or disagree 
with them. Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 23. Ms. Currie indicated during her first grand 
jury appearance that her memory about the events was "getting worse by the 
minute." Currie 1/27/98 GJ at 71. Later, Ms. Currie acknowledged that "closer to 
the event my recollection would be better." Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 182-183.

<P><A name=N_1033_>1033. </A>Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 65-66. Indeed, she testified 
that, at some point after January 18, she heard that Ms. Lewinsky visited the 
Oval Office on Saturdays, one of her days off. Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 65-66.

<P><A name=N_1036_>1036. </A>Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 14. The President, apparently, 
had a similar understanding of "alone." Before the grand jury, the President 
explained that "when I said, we were never alone, right . . . I meant that she 
[Ms. Currie] was always in the Oval Office complex, in that complex, while 
Monica was there." Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 132. <BR wp="br1"><BR wp="br2">
<P>Elsewhere in her testimony, Ms. Currie appeared to have a different 
understanding of "alone." She testified that, on one occasion, because others 
observed Ms. Lewinsky in the Oval Office complex, Ms. Currie accompanied Ms. 
Lewinsky into the Oval Office, where the President was working. Ms. Currie 
explained that she waited in the dining room while Ms. Lewinsky and the 
President met in the study so "[t]hey would not be alone." Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 
130. <U>See also</U> Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 56 ("I asked her specifically . . . 
to remain in the dining room, Betty, while I met with Monica in my study."). Ms.

enter the Oval Office to think that she and the President were "alone." Currie 
7/22/98 GJ at 132. 
<P><A name=N_1037_>1037. </A>Currie 7/22/98 GJ at 79. Ms. Currie testified: "The

to me that was the correct answer for me to give . . . the '[c]ome on to me,' I 
considered that more of a statement as opposed to a question." <U>Id.</U> at 80.

<P><A name=N_1068_>1068. </A>Mr. Lindsey, on instructions from the President, 
<U>see</U> Lindsey 8/28/98 GJ at 23, has invoked the presidential communication 
privilege, the deliberative process privilege, the governmental attorney-client 
privilege, and President Clinton's personal attorney-client privilege with 
regard to conversations with the President and has thus refused to disclose what 
the President said to him on January 21. Lindsey 2/19/98 GJ at 42. Mr. Lindsey 
has testified, however, that based on the President's public statements and 
statements made to others in Lindsey's presence, the President misled him about 
the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Lindsey 8/28/98 GJ at 93-96,

<P><A name=N_1077_>1077. </A>Ms. Currie could not recall whether the President 
called her into the Oval Office to discuss Ms. Lewinsky on Tuesday, January 20,

specifically recall this second conversation with Ms. Currie, but did not 
dispute that it took place: "I do not remember how many times I talked to Betty 
Currie or when. I don't. I can't possibly remember that. I do remember when I 
first heard about this story breaking, trying to ascertain what the facts were, 
trying to ascertain what Betty's perception was." Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 141-42.

<P><A name=N_1082_>1082. </A>Blumenthal 6/4/98 GJ at 48-49. When later asked how 
he interpreted the President's statement, "I haven't done anything wrong," Mr. 
Blumenthal stated, "My understanding was that the accusations against him which 
appeared in the press that day were false, that he had not done anything wrong. 
. . . He had not had a sexual relationship with her, and had not sought to 
obstruct justice or suborn perjury." Blumenthal 6/25/98 GJ at 26. 
<P><A name=N_1083_>1083. </A>Blumenthal 6/4/98 GJ at 49. The President said, 
"I've gone down that road before, I've caused pain for a lot of people and I'm 
not going to do that again." Blumenthal 6/4/98 GJ at 49. Mr. Blumenthal 
"understood [this statement] to mean that he had had an adulterous relationship 
in the past, which is something he made very plain to the American people in his 
"60 Minutes" interview with the First Lady, which is how he introduced himself 
to the public . . . . And it's been very well known." Blumenthal 6/25/98 GJ at 
32.

<P><A name=N_1088_>1088. </A>Podesta 6/16/98 GJ at 92. The President made 
another misleading statement about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to Mr. 
Podesta a few weeks later. According to Mr. Podesta, "[h]e said to me that after 
she [Ms. Lewinsky] left [the White House], that when she had come by, she came 
by to see Betty, and that he -- when she was there either Betty was with them -- 
either that she was with Betty when he saw her or that he saw her in the Oval 
Office with the door open and Betty was around -- and Betty was out at her 
desk." Podesta 6/16/98 GJ at 88.

<P><A name=N_1090_>1090. </A>Clinton 8/17/98/ GJ at 101, 106. The President was 
asked specifically whether he denied telling Mr. Podesta that he did not have 
any kind of sex whatsoever, including oral sex, with Ms. Lewinsky. The President 
responded: "I'm not saying that anybody who had a contrary memory is wrong. I do 
not remember." Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 105. 
<P><A name=N_1091_>1091. </A>In claiming that this statement was true, the 
President was apparently relying on the same tense-based distinction he made 
during the <U>Jones</U> deposition. <U>See</U> Clinton 8/17/98 GJ at 59-61 ("It 
depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If the -- if he -- if 'is' 
means is and never has been, that is not -- that is one thing. If it means there 
is none, that was a completely true statement. . . . Now, if someone had asked 
me on that day, are you having any kind of sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, 
that is, asked me a question in the present tense, I would have said no. And it 
would have been completely true.")

<P><A name=N_1101_>1101. </A><U>Roll</U> <U>Call</U>, <U>Inc.</U>, January 22, 
1998. President Clinton was extended invitations to appear before the grand jury 
and give his testimony on: January 28, 1998; February 4, 1998; February 9, 1998; 
February 21, 1998; March 2, 1998; and March 13, 1998. He declined all of these 
invitations. On July 16, 1998, the grand jury issued the President a subpoena. 
The President promptly moved for a postponement of two weeks in which to 
respond. At a hearing on the President's motion, Chief Judge Norma Holloway 
Johnson stated, "What we need to do is to move forward and move forward 
expeditiously. . . . [A]pparently the grand jury has determined that [they] need 
to hear from the [President]." <U>In re Grand Jury Proceedings</U>, Misc. No. 
98-267, July 28, 1998, at pp. 27-28. Before Judge Johnson ruled, the President's 
attorneys negotiated the terms of the President's appearance. 
<P><A name=N_1102_>1102. </A>Morris 8/18/98 GJ at 6, 10, 12. Mr. Morris was 
questioned after the President's grand jury appearance on August 17, 1998; 
accordingly, the OIC never had an opportunity to question the President about 
this conversation. 
<P><A name=N_1103_>1103. </A>Morris 8/18/98 GJ at 14. 
<P><A name=N_1104_>1104. </A>Mr. Morris testified that he interpreted the 
"something" to be sexual in nature. Morris 8/18/98 GJ at 94. 
<P><A name=N_1105_>1105. </A>Morris 8/18/98 GJ at 14.

<P><A name=N_1109_>1109. </A>Morris 8/18/98 GJ at 28. 
<P><A name=N_1110_>1110. </A>Morris 8/18/98 GJ at 30. 
<P><A name=N_1111_>1111. </A>Morris 8/18/98 GJ at 34. Mr. Morris believed that 
Ms. Lewinsky's credibility was in question based on a claim by a <U>USA 
Today</U> reporter that there was an occasion when the President and Mr. Morris 
spoke on the telephone while they each were involved in a sexual encounter. The 
President was reportedly "having sex" with Ms. Lewinsky while Mr. Morris was 
allegedly involved with a prostitute at the Jefferson Hotel. Morris 8/18/98 GJ 
at 32, 34. 
<P><A name=N_1112_>1112. </A>Morris 8/18/98 GJ at 35. 
<P><A name=N_1113_>1113. </A>Thomason 8/11/98 GJ at 6. 
<P><A name=N_1114_>1114. </A>Although Mr. Thomason originally offered to stay 
with the President for a "couple of days," he stayed at the White House 
Residence for 34 days. Thomason 8/11/98 GJ at 6, 10. Mr. Thomason testified that 
while "not particularly an expert in media matters . . . my wife and I seem to 
have a feel of what the rest of America is thinking. . . ." Thomason 8/11/98 GJ 
at 24. 
<P><A name=N_1115_>1115. </A>Thomason 8/11/98 GJ at 15-16. Mr. Thomason said he 
"went on the assumption that [the allegations] were not true," but he never 
asked the President because he talked to his attorney, Robert Bennett (also the 
President's personal attorney), who advised him "to make sure you don't ask 
questions that will get you subpoenaed." <U>Id.</U> at 22, 27. Mr. Thomason also 
testified he did not ask the President whether the denial was true because "I 
wanted it to be true and I felt it not to be true." <U>Id.</U> at 32-33.
