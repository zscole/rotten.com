<p><font SIZE=+1>THAT</font> whereas our Sovereign Lord the King had, by
the Advice and Assent of his Council, for divers weighty and urgent Occasions
concerning, his Majesty, the State, and Defence of the Church and Kingdom
of <i>England, </i>appointed a Parliament to be holden at his City of <i>Westminster;
</i>That <i>Henry Garnet</i>, Superior of the Jesuits within the Realm
<i>of England, </i>(called also by the several names of <i>Wally, Darcy,
Roberts, Farmer, and Henry Philips) Oswald Tesmond </i>Jesuit, otherwise
called <i>Oswald Greenwell, John Gerrard </i>Jesuit, (called also by the
several names of <i>Lee </i>and <i>Brooke) Robert Winter, Thomas Winter</i>,
Gentlemen, <i>Guy Fawkes</i> Gent. otherwise called <i>Guy</i> <i>Johnson,
Robert Keyes </i>Gent. and <i>Thomas Bates </i>Yeoman, late Servant to

<i>Robert Catesby </i>Esquire; together with the said <i>Robert Catesby
</i>and <i>Thomas Percy </i>Esquires, <i>John Wright and Christopher Wright
</i>Gentlemen, in open Rebellion and Insurrection against his Majesty,
lately slain, and <i>Francis Tresham </i>Esq; lately dead; as false Traitors
against our said Sovereign Lord the King, did traitorously meet and assemble
themselves together; and being so met, the said <i>Henry Garnet, Oswald
Tesmond, John Gerrard, </i>and other Jesuits, did maliciously, falsly,
and traitorously move and persuade as well the said <i>Thomas Winter, Guy
Fawkes, Robert Keyes, </i>and <i>Thomas Bates, </i>as the said <i>Robert
Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright, Christopher Wright, </i>and <i>Francis
Tresham, </i>That our said Sovereign Lord the King, the Nobility, Clergy,
and whole Commonalty of the Realm of <i>England, </i>(Papists excepted)
were Hereticks; and that all Hereticks were accursed and excommunicate;
and that none Heretick could be a King; but that it was lawful and meritorious
to kill our said Sovereign Lord the King, and all other Hereticks within
this Realm of <i>England, </i>for the Advancing and Enlargement of the
pretended and usurped Authority and Jurisdiction of the Bishop of <i>Rome</i>,
and for the restoring of the superstitious <i>Romish </i>Religion within
this Realm of <i>England. </i>To which traitorous Persuasions, the <i>said
Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates, Robert Catesby,
Thomas Percy, John Wright, Christopher Wright,</i> and <i>Francis Tresham,

</i>traitorously did yield their Assents: And that thereupon the said <i>Henry
Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John Gerrard, and </i>divers other Jesuits; <i>Thomas
Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes, </i>and<i> Thomas Bates, </i>as also
the said <i>Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright, Christopher Wright
and Francis Tresham, </i>traitorously amongst themselves did conclude and
agree, with Gunpowder, as it were with one Blast, suddenly, traitorously
and barbarously to blow up and tear in pieces our said Sovereign Lord the
King, the excellent, virtuous and gracious <i>Queen Anne, </i>his dearest
Wife, the most noble Prince <i>Henry,</i> their eldest Son, and future
Hope and Joy<i> </i>of <i>England; </i>and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
the Reverend Judges of the Realm, the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of
Parliament, and divers other faithful Subjects and Servants of the King
in the said Parliament, for the Causes aforesaid, to be assembled in the
House of Parliament; and all them, without any respect of Majesty, Dignity,
Degree, Sex, Age or Place, most barbarously, and more than beastly, traitorously
and suddenly to destroy and swallow up. And further did most traitorously
conspire and conclude among themselves, That not only the whole Royal Issue-Male
of our said Sovereign Lord the King should be destroyed and rooted out;
but that the Persons aforesaid, together with divers other false Traitors,
traitorously with them to be assembled, should surprize the Persons of
the most noble Ladies <i>Elizabeth </i>and <i>Mary,</i> Daughters of our
said Sovereign Lord the King, and falsly and traitorously should proclaim
the said Lady <i>Elizabeth</i> to be Queen of this Realm: And thereupon
should publish a Proclamation in the name of the said Lady <i>Elizabeth;

</i>wherein, as it was especially agreed by and between the said Conspirators,
That no mention should be made at the first, of the alteration of Religion
established within


within this Realm of <i>England</i>; neither would the said
false Traitors therein acknowledge themselves to be Authors, or Actors,
or Devisers of the aforesaid most wicked and horrible Treasons, until they
had got sufficient Power and Strength for the assured Execution and Accomplishment
of their said Conspiracy and Treason; and that then they would avow and
justify the said most wicked and horrible Treasons, as Actions that were
in the number of those, <i>Quae non laudantur, nisi peracta</i>, which
be not to be commended before they be done: but by the said feign'd and
traitorous Proclamation they would publish, That all and singular Abuses
and Grievances within this Realm of <i>England</i>, should, for satisfying
of the People, be reform'd. And that as well for the better concealing,
as for the more effectual accomplishing of the said horrible Treasons,
as well the said <i>Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes</i>, and <i>Thomas
Bates</i>, as the said <i>Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright, Christopher
Wright</i>, and <i>Francis Tresham</i>, by the traitorous Advice and Procurement
of the said <i>Henry Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John Gerrard</i>, and other
Jesuits, traitorously did further conclude and agree, that as well the
said <i>Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes</i>, and <i>Thomas Bates</i>,
as the said <i>Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright, Christopher Wright</i>,
and <i>Francis Tresham</i>, thereupon severally and traitorously should
receive several corporal Oaths upon the holy Evangelists, and the Sacrament
of the Eucharist, That they the Treasons aforesaid would traitorously conceal
and keep secret, and would not reveal them, directly or indirectly, by
Words or Circumstances, nor ever would desist from the Execution and final
Accomplishment of the said Treasons, without the consent of some three
of the aforesaid false Traitors first in that behalf traitorously had:
And that thereupon as well the said <i>Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert
Keyes, </i>and <i>Thomas Bates</i>, as the said <i>Robert Catesby, Thomas
Percy, John Wright, Christ. Wright</i>, and <i>Francis Tresham</i>, did
traitorously take the said several corporal Oaths severally, and did receive
the Sacrament of the Eucharist aforesaid, by the Hands of the said <i>Henry
Garnet, John Gerrard, Oswald Tesmond</i>, and other Jesuits. And further,
that the said <i>Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes,Robert Keyes</i>, and <i>Thomas
Bates</i>, together with the said <i>Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John
Wright,Christopher Wright</i>, and <i>Francis Tresham</i>, by the like
traitorous Advice and Counsel of the said <i>Henry Garnet, John Gerrard,
Oswald Tesmond</i>, and other Jesuits, for the more effectual compassing
and final execution of the said Treasons, did traitorously among themselves
conclude and agree to dig a certain Mine under the said House of Parliament,
and there secretly, under the said House, to bestow and place a great Quantity
of Gunpowder ; and that according to the said traitorous Conclusion, the
said <i>Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes</i>, and <i>Thomes Bates</i>,
together with the said <i>Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright</i>,
and <i>Christopher Wright</i>, afterwards secretly, not without great labour
and difficulty, did dig and make the said Mine unto the midst of the Foundation
of the Wall of the said House of Parliament, the said Foundation being
of the thickness of three yards, with a traitorous Intent to bestow and
place a great Quantity of Gunpowder in the Mine aforesaid, so as aforesaid
traitorously to be made for the traitorous accomplishing of their traitorous
Purposes aforesaid. And that the said <i>Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert
Keyes</i>, and <i>Thomas Bates</i>, together with the said <i>Robert Catesby,
Thomas Percy, John Wright</i>, and <i>Christopher Wright</i>, finding and
perceiving the said Work to be of great difficulty, by reason of the Hardness
and thickness of the said Wall ; and understanding a certain Cellar under
the said House of Parliament, and adjoining to a certain House of the said

<i>Thomas Percy</i>, then to be letten to farm for a yearly Rent, the said
<i>Thomas Percy</i>, by the traitorous Procurement, as well of the said
<i>Henry Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John Gerrard</i>, and other Jesuits, <i>Thomas
Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes</i>, and <i>Thomas Bates</i>, as of the
said <i>Robert Catesby, John Wright</i>, and <i>Christopher Wright</i>,
traitorously did hire the Cellar aforesaid for a certain yearly Rent and
Term: and then those Traitors did remove twenty Barrels full of Gunpowder
out of the said House of the said <i>Thomas Percy</i>, and secretly and
traitorously did bestow and place them in the Cellar aforesaid, under the
said House of Parliament, for the traitorous effecting of the Treason,
and traitorous Purposes aforesaid. And that afterwards the said <i>Henry
Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John Gerrard</i>, and other Jesuits, <i>Thomas
Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes</i> and <i>ThomasBates</i>, together with
the said <i>Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright</i>, and <i>Christopher
Wright</i> traitorously did meet with <i>Robert Winter, John Grant</i>,
and <i>Ambrose Rookwood</i>, and <i>Francis Tresham</i>, Esquires; and
traitorously did impart to the said <i>Robert Winter, John Grant, Ambrose
Rookwood</i>, and <i>Francis Tresham</i>, the Treasons, traitorous Intentions
and Purposes aforesaid ; and did require the said <i>Robert Winter, John
Grant, Ambrose Rookwood</i>, and <i>Francis Tresham</i>, to join themselves
as well with the said <i>Henry Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John Gerrard, Thomas
Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes</i>, and <i>Thomas Bates</i>, as with
the said <i>Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright</i>, and <i>Christopher
Wright</i>, in the Treasons, traitorous Intentions and Purposes aforesaid;
and traitorously to provide Horse, Armour, and other Necessaries, for the
better Accomplishment and effecting of the said Treasons. To which traitorous
Motion and Request, the said <i>Robert Winter, John Grant, Ambrose Rookwood</i>,
and <i>Francis Tresham</i>, did traitorously yield their Assents, and as
well with the said <i>Henry Garnet, Oswald Tesmond, John Gerrard, Robert
Winter, Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes</i>, and <i>Thomas Bates</i>,
as with the said <i>Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright, Christopher
Wright</i>, and <i>Francis Tresham</i>, in the said Treasons, traitorous
Intentions and Purposes aforesaid, traitorously did adhere and unite themselves:
And thereupon several corporal Oaths, in form abovesaid, traitorously did
take, and the Sacrament of the Eucharist, by the hands of the said Jesuits
did receive, to such intent and Purpose, as is aforesaid; and Horses, Armour,
and other Necessaries for the better effecting of the said Treasons, according
to their traitorous Assents aforesaid, traitorously did provide. And that
afterwards all the said false Traitors did traitorously provide, and bring
into the Cellar aforesaid ten other Barrels full of Gunpowder, newly bought,
fearing lest the former Gunpowder, so as aforesaid bestow'd and placed
there, was become dankish; and the said several Quantities of: Gunpowder
aforesaid, with Billets and Faggots, lest they should be spy'd, secretly
and traitorously did cover. And that afterwards the said false Traitors
traitorously provided, and brought into the Cellar aforesaid, four Hogsheads
full of Gunpowder, and laid divers great Iron Bars and Stones upon the
said four Hogsheads, and the aforesaid other Quantities of Gunpowder: And
the said Quantities of Gunpowder, Bars, and Stones, with Billets and Faggots,
lest they should be espy'd, secretly and traitorously did likewise cover.
And that the said <i>Guy Fawkes</i>, afterwards, for a full and final Accomplishment
of the said Treasons, traitorous Intentions and Purposes aforesaid, by
the traitorous Procurement, as well of the said <i>Henry Garnet, Oswald
Tesmond, John Gerrard</i>, and other Jesuits, <i>Robert Winter, Thomas
Winter, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates, John Grant</i>, and <i>Ambrose Rookwood</i>,
as of the said <i>Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright, Christopher
Wright</i>, and <i>Francis Tresham</i>, traitorously had prepared, and
had upon his Person Touchwood and Match, therewith traitorously to give
fire to the several Barrels, Hogsheads, and Quantities of Gunpowder aforesaid,
at the time appointed for the Execution of the said horrible Treasons.
And further, that after the said horrible Treasons were, by the great Favour
and Mercy of God, in a wonderful manner discover'd, not many hours before
it should have been executed, as well the said <i>Henry Garnet, Oswald
Tesmond, John Gerrard, Robert Winter,Thomas Winter, Robert Keyes, Thomas
Bates, John Grant</i>, and <i>Ambrose Rookwood</i>, as the said <i>Robert
Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright</i>, and <i>Christopher Wright</i>,
traitorously did fly and withdraw themselves, to the intent traitorously
to stir up and procure such Popish Persons, as they could, to join with
them in actual, publick and open Rebellion against our said Sovereign Lord
the King; and to that end did publish divers feigned and false Rumours,
that the Papists Throats should have been cut; and that thereupon divers
Papists were in Arms, and in open, publick, and actual Rebellion against
our said Sovereign Lord the King, in divers Parts of this Realm of <i>England</i>.</p>

<p> To this Indictment they all pleaded, Not guilty; and put themselves
upon God and the Country.</p>

<p> Then did Sir <i>Edward Philips</i>, Kt. his Majesty's Serjeant at Law;
open the Indictment to this effect, as followeth.</p>

<p> The matter that is now to be offer'd to you my Lords the Commissioners,
and to the Trial of you the Knights and Gentlemen of the Jury, is Matter
of Treason; but of such Horror, and monstrous Nature, that before now,
</p>

<blockquote>
The Tongue of Man never deliver'd,<br>

The Ear of Man never heard,<br>
The Heart of Man never conceited, <br>
Nor the Malice of hellish or earthly Devil ever practised.<br>
</blockquote>

For, if it be abominable to murder the least;<br>
If to touch God's Anointed be to oppose themselves against God;<br>
If (by Blood) to subvert Princes, States and Kingdoms, be hateful to God
and Man, as all true Christians must acknowledge:<br>
Then, how much more than too too monstrous shall all Christian Hearts judge
the Horror of this Treason; to murder and subvert<br>

<blockquote>
Such a King,<br>
Such a Queen,<br>
Such a Prince,<br>
Such a Progeny,<br>
Such a State,<br>
Such a Government,<br>
So complete and absolute,<br>
</blockquote>

<p>That God approves,<br>
The World admires,<br>
All true <i>English</i> Hearts honour and reverence,<br>
The Pope and his Disciples only envies and maligns?</p>

<p> The Proceeding wherein, is properly to be divided into three general
Heads. </p>

<blockquote>
First, Matter of Declaration.<br>
Secondly, Matter of Aggravation.<br>
Thirdly, Matter of Probation. <br>
</blockquote>

<p>My self am limited to deal only with the Matter of Declaration, and
that is contain'd within the Compass of the Indictment only.<br>
For the other two, I am to leave to him to whose Place it belongeth.<br>
The Substance of which Declaration consisteth in four Parts. </p>

<blockquote>

First, In the Persons and Qualities of the Conspirators.<br>
Secondly, In the Matter conspired. <br>
Thirdly, In the Mean and Manner of the Proceeding and Execution of
the Conspiracy. <br>
And fourthly, Of the End and Purpose why it was so conspired. <br>
</blockquote>

<p>As concerning the first, being the Persons ; they were, <i>Garnet, Gerrard,
Tesmond</i>, Jesuits not then taken. <i>Thomas Winter, Guy Fawkes, Robert
Keyes, Thomas Bates, Everard Digby, Ambrose Rookwood, John Grant, Robert
Winter</i>, at the Bar. <i>Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy, John Wright, Christopher
Wright</i>, slain in Rebellion. <i>Francis Tresham</i>, lately dead. All
grounded Romanists and corrupted Scholars of so irreligious and traitorous
a School.<br>

As concerning the second, which is the Matter conspired; it was, </p>

<center><table>
<tr>
<td>First, To deprive the King of his Crown. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Secondly, To murder the King, the Queen, and the Prince. </td>

Strangers to invade it. </td>

</table></center>

<p>As concerning the third, which is the Mean and Manner how to compass
and execute the same; they did all conclude, </p>

<center><table>
<tr>

<tr>

King, and all the said Hereticks.</td>

<p>The Mean to effect it, they concluded to be, that, </p>

<center><table>
<tr>

the Knights and Burgesses of the Parliament, should be blown up with Powder.
</td>

<i>Mary</i> the King's Daughters, and proclaim the Lady <i>Elizabeth</i>
Queen.</td>

<tr>
<td>Fourthly, That they should feign a Proclamation in the name of <i>Elizabeth</i>,
in which no mention should be made of Alteration of Religion, 
<start page 235 col 1>
nor that they were Parties to the Treason, until they 
had raised Power to   perform the same; and then to 
proclaim, All Grievances in the Kingdom should   be 
reformed.  <p>


          That they also took Several Oaths, and receiv'd  
the Sacrament; First, for   Secrecy; Secondly, for 
Prosecution; except they were discharg'd thereof by   
three of them.  <p>
          

          That  after the Destruction of the King, the Queen, 
the Prince, the Royal Issue   Male, the Lords 
Spiritual and Temporal, the Knights and Burgesses, 
they   should notify the same to foreign States; and 
thereupon Sir <i>Edmund Baynam</i>  an attainted 
Person of Treason, and styling himself Prime of the 
damned   Crew, should be sent and make the same known 
to the Pope, and crave his   Aid: an Embassador fit 
both for the Message and Persons, to be sent 
betwixt   the Pope and the Devil.  <p>

          

          That the Parliament being prorogued till the 7th of 
<i>February</i>, they in   <i>December</i> made a 
Mine under the House of Parliament, purposing to   
place, their Powder there; but the Parliament being 
then further adjourned till   the 3d of 
<i>October</i>, they in Lent following hired the 
Vault, and placed therein 20   Barrels of Powder.<p>
          

          That they took to them, <i>Robert Winter,

Munition.

<font size=-1>* Sir Edward Coke </font>* <i>Attor. General.</i> It appeareth to your Lordships, and to 
the rest of   this most honourable and grave Assembly, even  
by that which Mr. Serjeant hath already opened, that these   are 
the greatest treasons that ever were plotted in <i>England</i>, and concern   
the greatest King that ever was of <i>England</i>. But when this Assembly 
shall further  hear, and see discovered the Roots and Branches of the same, not   
hitherto published, they will say indeed, <i>Quis haec posteris sic narrare 
peterit, ut facta non ficta esse videantur ?</i> That when these things shall be 
related to   Posterity, they will be reputed matters feigned,
not done. And therefore in this so great a Cause, upon the Carriage and   Event 
whereof the Eye of all Christendom is at this day bent; I shall desire that
I may with your patience be somewhat more copious, and not so succint, as   my 
usual manner hath been; and yet will I be no longer than the very   matter it self 
shall necessarily require. But before I enter into the particular   Narration of this 
Cause, I hold it fit to give Satisfaction to some, and those well   affected amongst 
us, who have not only marvelled, but grieved, that no speedier   Expedition hath 
been used in these Proceedings, considering the   Monstrousness and 
continual Horror of this so desperate a Cause.

<ol>
<li>It is, <i>Ordo Naturae</i>, agreeable to the Order of Nature, that things 
of great   weight and magnitude should slowly proceed, according to that of the 
Poet, <i>Tarda solet magnis rebus adesse fides</i>. And surely of these 
things   we may truly say, <i>Nunquam ante dies nostros talia acciderunt</i>;  
neither hath the Eye of Man seen, nor the Ear of Man heard the like things to 
these.</li><p>  

<li><i>Veritas temporis filia</i>, Truth is the Daughter of Time; especially in 
this Case,   wherein by timely and often Examinations, <i>First</i>, Matters of 
greatest   moment have been lately found out. <i>Secondly</i>, Some 
known Offenders,   and those capital, but lately, apprehended. <i>Thirdly</i>, 
Sundry of the principal Arch-Traitors before unknown, now manifested, as the 
Jesuits.   <i>Fourthly</i>, Heretical, treasonable and damnable Books lately 
found out; one of 
Equivocation, and another, <i>De officio Principis 
Christiani</i>, of <i>Francis Tresham</i>'s.</li><p>

<li>There have been already twenty and three several 
days spent in Examinations.</li><p>

<li>We should otherwise have hanged a Man unattainted, 
for <i>Guy Fawkes</i> passed for a time under the 
name of <i>John Johnson</i>:  So that if by that name 
greater Expedition had been made, and he hanged, 
though we had not missed of the Man, yet the 
Proceeding would not have been so orderly or 
justifiable.</li><p>

<li>The King out of his Wisdom and great Moderation, 
was pleased to appoint this Trial in time of 
Assembly in Parliament, for that it concerned 
especially those of the Parliament.</li>
</ol>
Now touching the Offences themselves, they are so 
exorbitant and transcendent, and aggregated of so 
many bloody and fearful Crimes, as they cannot be 
aggravated by any Inference, Argument or Circumstance 
whatsoever; and that in three respects:<p>

          <i>First</i>, Because this Offence is <i>Primæ 
impressionis</i>, and therefore <i>sine Nomine</i>, 
without any name which might be <i>adæquatum</i>, 
sufficient to express it, given by any Legist, that 
ever made or writ of any Laws. For the highest 
Treason that all they could imagine, they called it 
only <i>Crimen læsæ Majestatis</i>, the violating of 
the Majesty of the Prince. But this Treason doth want 
an apt name, as tending not only to the Hurt, but to 
the Death of the King; and not the Death of the King 
only, but of his whole Kingdom, <i>Non Regis sed 
Regni</i>, that is, to the Destruction and 
Dissolution of the Frame and Fabrick of this antient, 
famous, and ever-flourishing Monarchy; even the 
Deletion of our whole Name and Nation: <i>And 
therefore hold not thy tongue, O God, keep not still 
silence, refrain not thy self, O God; for lo thine 
Enemies make a murmuring, and they that hate thee 
have lift up their  Heads: They have said, Come, and 
let us  root them out, that they be no more a People, 
and that the Name of</i> Israel<i> may be no more in 
remembrance</i>. Psal. 83. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.<p>

         <i>Secondly</i>, It is, <i>Sine exemplo</i>, beyond 
all Examples, whether in Fact or Fiction, even of the 
tragick Poets, who did beat their Wits to represent 
the most fearful and horrible Murders.<p>
         <i>Thirdly</i>, It is, <i>Sine modo</i>, without 
all measure or stint of Iniquity; like a Mathematical 
Line, which is, <i>divisibilis in semper 
divisibilia</i>, infinitely divisible.<p>
         It is Treason to imagine or intend the Death of the 
King, Queen, or Prince.<p>

 For Treason is like a Tree whose Root is full of 
 Poison, and lieth secret and hid within the Earth, resembling the 
Imagination of the Heart of 
Man, which is so secret as God only knoweth it.<p>

	Now the Wisdom of the Law provideth for the blasting and nipping, 
both   of the Leaves, Blossoms, and Buds which proceed from this Root of   
Treason; either by Words, which are like to Leaves, or by some overt  Act,  
which may be resembled to Buds or Blossoms, before it cometh to such   
Fruit and Ripeness, as would bring utter Destruction and Desolation  
upon  the whole State.<p>
	It is likewise Treason to kill the Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, or  
any  Justice of the one Bench or other; Justices of Assize, or any other  
Judge  mentioned in the Statute of 25 <i>Edw</i>. III. sitting in their 
Judicial  Places,  and exercising their Offices. And the Reason is, for that 
every Judge  so fitting  by the King's Authority, representeth the Majesty 
and Person of  the King; and therefore it is <i>Crimen læsæ
Majestatis</i>, to kill him,  the King  being always in Judgment of 
Law present in Court.  But
in the high Court of Parliament, every Man by virtue of the King's 
Authority,   by Writ under the Great Seal, hath a judicial Place; and so   
consequently the killing of every of them had been a several Treason, and 
<i>Crimen læsæ Majestatis</i>. Besides that to their treasons were added

Rebellion, Burglary, Robbery, Horse-stealing, <i>&c</i>. So that this 
Offence is such, as no Man can express it, No Example pattern it, no 
Measure contain it.<p>

	Concerning foreign Princes; there was here a Protestation made for 
the clearing of them from all Imputation and Aspersion whatsoever.<p>
<i>	First</i>, For that whilst Kingdoms stood in Hostility, hostile Actions are

	holden honourable and just.<p>

<i>Secondly</i>, It is not the King's Serjeant, Attorney, or Sollicitor, that in
any sort touch or mention them: For we know that great Princes and

Personages are reverently and respectfully to be spoken of; and that there is   
<i>Lex in sermone tenenda</i>.  But it is <i>Fawkes, Winter</i>, and the rest 
of the
Offenders, that have confessed so much as hath been said: And therefore the   
King's Counsel Learned doth but repeat the Offender's Confession, and   
charge or touch no other Person. They have also slander'd unjustly our   great 
Master King <i>James</i>, which we only repeat, to shew the Wickedness  
and  Malice of the Offenders.<p>

	<i>Thirdly</i>, So much as is said concerning foreign Princes, is so woven 
into the  matter of the Charge of these Offenders, as it cannot be sever'd,
or singled from the rest of the matter; so as it is inevitable, and  cannot 
be 
pretermitted.<p
>
	Now as this Powder-Treason is in itself prodigious and unnatural, so 
it is in  the Conception and Birth most monstrous, as arising out of the 
dead Ashes   of former Treasons. For it had three Roots, all planted and 
watered by  Jesuits,  and <i>English</i> Romish Catholicks: The first 
Root in <i>England</i>,  in <i>December</i> and  <i>March</i>; the 
second in <i>F1anders</i>, in <i>June</i>; the third in  <i>Spain</i>, in 

<i>July</i>. In <i>England</i> it had two Branches, one in 
<i>December</i> was  twelve Months before  the death of the late 
Queen of blessed Memory;  another in <i>March</i> wherein she 
died.<p>
	First in <i>December</i>, <i>Anno Dom</i>. 1601. do <i>Henry 
Garnet</i> Superior of the Jesuits in <i>England</i>, <i>Robert 
Tesmond</i> Jesuit, <i>Robert Catesby</i> (who was <i>bono <check 
???>

subacto & versuto ingenio & profunda perfidia)</i> together with 
<i>Francis
	Tresham</i> and others, in the names, and for the behalf of all the 
<i>English</i> Romish 
Catholicks, imploy <i>Thomas Winter</i> into <i>Spain</i>, as for the general 
good of
the Romish Catholick Cause; and by him doth <i>Garnet</i> write his Letters to
Father <i>Creswell</i>, Jesuit residing in <i>Spain</i>, in that behalf. With 

<i>Thomas Winter</i>
doth <i>Tesmond</i>, alias <i>Greeneway</i> the Jesuit, go as an Associate 
and
Confederate in that Conspiracy. The Message (which was principally
committed unto the said <i>Winter)</i> was, that he should make a Proposition
and Request to the King of <i>Spain</i>, in the behalf and names of the 
<i>English</i> 
Catholicks, That the King would send an Army hither into <i>England</i>,
and that the Forces of the Catholicks in <i>England</i> should be prepared to
join with him, and do him Service. And further, that he should move
the King of <i>Spain</i> to  bestow some Pensions here in <i>England</i>, 
upon sundry Persons Catholicks, and devoted to his Service:  And moreover, 
to give Advertisement, that the said King of <i>Spain</i>, making use of the 
general Discontentment that young Gentlemen and Soldiers were in, might no 
doubt, by relieving their Necessities, have them all at his Devotion.<p>

And because that in all Attempts upon <i>England</i>, the greatest 
Difficulty was ever to be found to be the Transportation of Horses; the 
Catholicks in <i>England</i> would assure the King of <i>Spain</i> to have 
always in readiness for his Use and Service, 1500 or 2000 Horses, against any 
occasion or enterprize.  Now <i>Thomas Winter</i> undertaking this 
Negotiation, and with
<i>Tesmond</i> the Jesuit coming into <i>Spain</i>, by means of Father  

<i>Creswell</i> the  Legier Jesuit there, as hath been said, had readily  
Speech with <i> Don Pedro Francesa</i> second Secretary of State, to 
whom he imparted his Message, as also to the Duke of <i>Lerma</i>; 
who assured him, that it would be an Office  very grateful to his Master, 
and that it should not want his best Furtherance.<p>
	Concerning the Place for landing of the King of <i>Spain's</i>  Army, 
which from the <i>English</i> Romish Catholicks he desired might be 
sent to invade the Land; it was resolved, That if the Army were great, then 

<i>Essex</i> and <i>Kent</i> were judged fittest, (where note by the way, 
Who was then Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports :) If the Army were small, 
and trusted upon Succour in <i>England</i>, then 
<i>Milford-haven</i> was thought more convenient.<p>
	Now there being at that time Hostility betwixt both Kingdoms, the King 
of <i>Spain</i> willingly embraced the Motion, saying, that he took the 
Message from the Catholicks very kindly, and that in all things he would  
respect them with as great Care as his proper <i>Castilians</i>. But 
for his further answer, and full dispatch, <i>Thomas Winter</i> was 
appointed to attend the Progress. In the end whereof, being in Summer time, 
Count <i>Miranda</i> gave him this answer in the behalf of his Master, 
That the King would bestow 100000 Crowns to that use, half to be paid that 
Year, and the rest the next Spring following; and withal required that we 
should be as good as our Promise, for the next Spring he meant to be with 

us, and set foot in <i>England</i>. And lastly, he desired on the King's 
behalf, of <i>Winter</i>, that he might have certain Advertisement and 
Intelligence, if so it should in the mean time happen that the Queen did die. 

<i>Tho. Winter</i> laden with these Hopes, returns into <i>England</i> 
about a Month before <i>Christmas</i>, and delivered answer of all that 
had passed, to <i>Henry Garnet, Robert Catesby</i>, and <i>Francis 
Tresham</i>. But soon after set that glorious Light, her Majesty died: 
<i>Mira cano; Sol occubuit, Nox nulla secuta est</i>.<p>
Presently after whose Death was <i>Christopher Wright</i>, another 
Messenger sent over into <i>Spain</i> by <i>Garnet</i>, (who 
likewise did write by
	him to <i>Creswell</i>,  for the furtherance of the Negotiation) 

<i>Catesby</i> and <i>Tresham</i>, in the name and behalf of all the Romish Catholicks in
<i>England</i>; as well to carry News of her Majesty's Death, as also to 
continue the aforesaid Negotiation for an Invasion and Pensions, which
by <i>Tho. Winter</i> had before been dealt in.  And in the <i>Spanish</i> Court,
about two Months after his arrival there, doth <i>Christopher Wright</i> meet
with <i>Guy Fawkes</i>; who upon the 22d of <i>June</i> was employed out of

<i>Flanders</i> from <i>Brussels</i> by Sir <i>William Stanley, Hugh Owen</i>, (whose
Finger hath been in every Treason which hath been of late Years
detected) and <i>Baldwyn</i> the Legier Jesuit in <i>Flanders</i>; from whom
likewise the said <i>Fawkes</i> carried Letters to <i>Creswell</i> in <i>Spain</i>, for the
countenancing and furtherance of his Affairs.


<p>
Now the End of <i>Fawkes</i>'s imployment was, to give Advertisement to
the King of <i>Spain</i>, how the King of <i>England</i> was like to proceed
rigorously with the Catholicks, and to run the same course which the
late Queen did; and withal to intreat that it would please him to send
an Army into <i>England</i> to <i>Milford-haven</i>, where the Romish Catholicks
would be ready to assist him;  and then the Forces that should be transported
in <i>Spinola</i>'s Gallies, should be landed where they could most
conveniently. And these their several Messages did <i>Christopher Wright</i> and

<i>Guy Fawkes</i> in the end intimate and propound to  the King of <i>Spain</i>. But
the King as then very honourably answered them both, that he would
not in any wise further listen to any such Motion, as having before
dispatched an Embassy into <i>England</i>, to treat concerning Peace.  Therefore
this Course by foreign Forces failing, they fell to the Powder-Plot, 
<i>Catesby</i> and <i>Tresham</i> being in at all; in the Treason of the Earl of <i>Essex</i>,
in the Treason of <i>Watson</i> and <i>Clarke</i> Seminary Priests, and also in this of
the Jesuits; such a greedy Appetite had they to practise against the 
State.<p>

The rest of that which Mr. Attorney then spake continuedly, was by
himself divided into three general Parts. The first containing certain
Considerations concerning this Treason. The second Observations about the same.
The third a Comparison of this treason of the Jesuits,
with that of the Seminary Priests, and that of <i>Raleigh</i> and others.
