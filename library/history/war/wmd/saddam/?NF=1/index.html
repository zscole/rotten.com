President <a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George W Bush</a> had a serious problem. In 2002, he was trying to sell the American people a war against Iraqi despot <a href="/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a>. But despite a wide selection of rationales offered to justify the thing, very few people were buying. When none of his advertising slogans seemed to be working, Bush had no choice but to employ a little old-fashioned puffery.
<p>

So the President and his lackeys tweaked the message. They started promoting the idea that Saddam currently possessed significant <a href="/library/history/war/wmd/">weapons of mass destruction</a>, poised to strike the United States and Britain. <i>That</i> certainly got people's attention. In fact, it scared the shit out of them. Public opinion quickly swayed in favor of military intervention, and the rest is history.
<p>

Since the war, however, millions of Americans have concluded that they are victims of false advertising. None of the fabled WMDs has actually shown up, despite months of intensive searching. Understandably, people feel they were lied to.
<p>

But let's start at the beginning. Prior to the 2001 <a href="/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">al Qaeda</a> attacks against the Pentagon and the <a href="/library/history/wtc/">World Trade Center</a>, Bush and his administration were openly uncommitted as to whether there were any extant WMDs in Iraq:

Then Secretary of State Colin Powell went to the United Nations for a Show 'N Tell presentation. He passed around recent surveillance photos taken of Iraqi WMD sites. According to Powell, the black-and-white pictures depicted a chemical weapons complex in Al-Musayyib, as well as 15 chemical weapons bunkers in Taji.

Although the briefing was vague on many details, Powell's exhibits were too specific and numerous to be ignored. Taken in total, they seemed to portray an ongoing biological and chemical weapons production effort under way in Iraq.

On May 1st, President Bush declared the end of combat operations from the flight deck of the USS <i>Abraham Lincoln</i>, an aircraft carrier protecting the dangerous waters off San Diego harbor. By then, two mysterious developments had cast serious doubts on the WMD hunt (which began to resemble more and more <a href="/library/bio/journalists/geraldo-rivera/">Geraldo Rivera</a>'s 1986 live TV special <i>The Mystery of <a href="/library/bio/crime/mafia/al-capone/">Al Capone</a>'s Vault</i>):

<li>During the invasion, Iraqi defense forces had somehow restrained themselves from dipping into their stockpiles of chemical agents to use against the American aggressors.</li>
<p>

<li>In the aftermath of the fighting, none of Iraq's weapons caches were found to contain even slight traces of the offending materials. Not even the sites depicted in satellite photography presented by Colin Powell in his U.N. speech.</li>

Perplexing. After a few more attempts at putting on a brave face, administration officials began to offer excuses why nothing had turned up yet. And the excuses would become more labored as time went on.

<h1>Media Coverage</h1>

Outside the government, everybody's got their pet theories on the unfolding WMD debacle. And that naturally includes members of the media. Most political pundits picked sides on the WMD debate early on, and the ones who lined up behind the White House are beginning to feel the heat.
<p>

Case in point: Fox News Channel's own <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/pundits/bill-oreilly/">Bill O'Reilly</a>. For several months, O'Reilly was playing a little game regarding the WMD situation in Iraq. Originally, Bill was convinced that when we liberated Iraq, there would be WMDs aplenty. Back in March 2003, he went so far as to tell the <i>Good Morning America</i> viewers that "if the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean, he has nothing, I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush administration again."
<p>

Months later, after President Bush declared the end of combat operations in Iraq and still no weapons of mass destruction had been uncovered, O'Reilly started to regret those words. So he gave the White House an ultimatum to come clean about the WMDs "in the next few weeks." But when that deadline was about to expire, Bill offered a <i>new</i> expiration date, granting the President <b>an additional five months</b>. Five weeks later, when it became obvious that the administration had no intention of meeting O'Reilly's decree, Bill extended it <b>another six months</b>. When you add it all up, the drop-dead date was dragged out <b>one full year</b>. How's <i>that</i> for accommodating?
<p>

In effect, Bill kept hitting the snooze button on his WMD deadline to avoid (or at least postpone) apologizing to the nation and declaring his mistrust for the Bush administration, two things he probably never had any intention of doing under any circumstances. But, in the end, it became unavoidable.

<td valign=top><font size=-1>On his television show <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>, Bill O'Reilly declares: "Reasonable people are faced with two conclusions -- one, that the intelligence was wrong, or, two, that more time is needed to find the weapons. <i>Talking Points</i> just asks one thing from President Bush: an update on the situation <b>in the next few weeks</b>.  That's a very reasonable request, and one the President must take seriously if he wants to advance the cause of the USA throughout the world. In the end, if the intelligence was faulty, some people have to be fired. If, God forbid, the intelligence was contrived, and I don't believe that, but if it is proven, then Congressional action must be taken."</font></td>
