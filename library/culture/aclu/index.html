<h1>ACLU</h1>
<h2>American Civil Liberties Union</h2>

Loathed by <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/pundits/bill-oreilly/">Bill O'Reilly</a>, <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/pat-robertson/">Pat Robertson</a>, and <a href="/library/bio/religion/televangelists/jerry-falwell/">Jerry Falwell</a>. And with good reason. They represented American Nazis in 1978, NAMBLA in 2000, and they consistently oppose any governmental endorsement of religion. That includes school-imposed prayers, as well as nativity scenes and Ten Commandments monuments on public property.
<p>
ACLU strangely refuses to take a position on the civil liberty issue of gun rights.
<p>

<!--
According to one critic, here are some of the ACLU's official positions.
