<h1>The Choking Game</h1>

<p>Children grow increasingly resourceful with each passing day. They
  don't require fancy battery-operated toys, bleepity-bloop video games
  or Pok&eacute;mon cards to have a good time. Those things are expensive. How's a
  kid gonna secure <i>that</i> kind of money? The best things in life
  are <b>free</b> after all. If you're a young person who's into extreme sports,
  hangin' out with trusted friends and kickin' back for good clean fun without
  cigarettes, <a href="/library/crime/drugs/methamphetamine/">drugs</a> or alcohol -- you can achieve a <i>natural</i> high
  by playing <b>the choking game.</b></p>
<p>The choking game is suitable for one or more players aged 6-15. Any quiet
  room in your house, tool shed, or garage can be turned into a choking
  arena. The game requires a fair amount of concentration, so lock the door firmly
  behind you and crank up the iTunes. <img src="cg_2dudes.jpg" width="308" height="356" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >The
  simplest props located right inside one's own home usually work the best. Have
  one player bring a length of cord, maybe an Ethernet cable or jump rope. Christmas
  ribbons work well, but they need to be thick, double-weave, and plenty strong.
  Surely somewhere in the rear of dad's closet there's a necktie which hasn't
  been worn in several decades. If you or your neighbor has a dog, ask an adult
  if you can borrow the leash.</p>
<p>Like Chinese Checkers, many different variations of the choking game exist
  -- but they all follow the same basic format. What's the <b>first rule</b> of
  the choking game? Everyone playing <i>must get choked</i>  at
  least once. Players can draw names from a hat, take turns in alphabetical order,
  spin a simple rainbow dial or roll dice to establish who gets choked in
  what order. It's considered good form to let new or inexperienced players go
  first.</p>
<p>Players use their hands, their arms,
  or props against the neck, to cut off the flow of oxygen to the head. When
the pressure is finally released, the blood rushes back to the brain. The object
of the game is to secure a level of asphyxiation which causes a fun tingle --
  but <i>not</i> paralysis, death or permanent disability. The first
  player to get so high he or she passes out is the winner! If
  you suffer from asthma, you're likely to win the choking game over and over,
  so <b>play fair.</b> Always let less experienced participants on your team have a
  go first. </p>
<p><img src="cg_ball.jpg" width="299" height="360" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >The
  choking game has a rich and varied history dating back several generations.
  As early as the late 1800s, the choking game was referred to as  <i>Harvey
  Wallbanger</i> -- named after a cocktail for grownups made from vodka or gin,
  orange juice, and Galliano. Pre-teen students sneaking cloves behind the Victorian
  preparatory portables might be seen clamping each other's necks and "banging"
  them up against a wall or a tree.</p>
<p>To this day, kids genuinely appear to love the choking game as they might
  any national pastime. It gives players a decent head rush, causing a momentary
  sense of floating or flying. It's a fun, easily affordable truth-or-dare thrill
  ride. In groups, it's universally lauded as <b>more
    than amusing</b> to
  witness fellow players stumbling around, hyperventilating as they lose consciousness,
  making funny choking faces, watching their eyeballs roll around, falling down,
    and generally behaving in a silly manner. For players completely unfamiliar
    (or uncomfortable) with drugs, the choking game approximates a mild <a href="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/">stoner</a>
    euphoria for a few brief seconds. </p>
<p><img src="cg_jchoke.jpg" width="328" height="392" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" >Meanwhile, party poopers like Sheriff Don Hunter from the the Collier County
  Sheriff's Office in Naples, Florida believes the choking game is actually
  life-threatening. "Kids have no idea how dangerous this activity is -- and
  they are unaware of the potentially deadly consequences." Hunter has studied
  the choking game phenomenon for many years. He cites players as young as 6
  or 7, who lack sufficient resources to indulge in more traditional highs like
  drugs or alcohol. Individuals who play the choking game are "thrill seekers,"
  Hunter warns. Children play the game mostly out of peer pressure or curiosity
  about their developing bodies and the associated feelings which come from experimentation.
The activity is considered "cool" and "risky".</p>
<p>Jean Porrazzo of <i>The Enterprise</i> news publication in Boston quotes statistics
  as recent as February of 2006, which claim 500 to 1000 deaths are reported
  each year as the result of recreational choking. Many of these deaths are initially
  reported as suicides. Both Oprah Winfrey and <a href="/library/bio/mad-science/dr-phil/">Dr. Phil</a> have devoted multiple
  segments to address the phenomenon, each focusing primarily on Disastrous
  Outcomes. Message boards are clogged with misspelled missives from outraged
  parents, many of whom are shocked and deeply saddened to learn about "the
  Choacking Game". </p>
<p><img src="cg_bart.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" >Bill
  Colburn, the police chief in the New Hampshire county where 14-year-old Rodney
  Webster died from choking-related asphyxiation told <i>The Guardian</i> that
  attempts to warn parents might serve only to publicize the choking game further. "I
  have grave concerns [about that], and that's why I'm very reluctant to talk
  with journalists like yourself," he said. "I really don't want to
  sensationalize this."</p>
<p>In 1999, a 15-year-old British pupil at Eton in Berkshire died from playing
  the English version of the choking game. He was found hanging from a dressing-gown
  cord. During a school investigation, the headmaster determined that anywhere
  from 8 to 10 pupils had been involved.</p>
<p>One popular 15-year-old female student in Lawrence, Kansas was found dead
  in her bedroom as the result of compression of the neck. A report by the <i>Lawrence
  Journal World</i> revealed that the girl had wrapped a plastic-coated bicycle
  chain lock around her neck, looped the chain over a dresser drawer, and seated
  herself in a position that cut off her air supply.</p>
<p><img src="cg_scouts.jpg" width="413" height="257" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />Another 15-year-old, a sophomore Danielle Hibler at Canon-McMillan High
  School near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania wrote an article entitled "A Dangerous
  Game Exposed" -- summarily cut from the paper at the request of the vice principal. </p>
<p>"She put a big X on the first page," Danielle said. "I was
  upset about it."</p>
<p>Angered by the decision, Danielle went to Assistant Principal Marella Kazos,
who defended the decision. The day her story was banned, she went home to see
  news reports about the death of a 13-year-old  who died from the game. Like
  Sleepy Smurf, the boy was found "blue and unresponsive". Journalist Hibler
  has since proclaimed her First Amendment rights have been violated. </p>
<p>Choking games are marketed in a variety
  of kid-friendly flavors like an underground street drug, complete with
  a full suite of cool-sounding, parent-proof nicknames. Airplaning, American
  Dream, Black out, Black Hole, Breath Play, California High, Choke Out, Cloud
  Nine, Fainting, Flatliner, Funky Chicken, Hanging, Hyperventilation,
  Knockout, Pass-out, Natural High, Rising Sun, Space Cowboy, Space Monkey, Suffocation
  Roulette, Tingle, and The Willies. Any
  one of these elite titles might easily be patented, packaged and distributed
by Milton Bradley, Parker Bros., or Wizards of the Coast. </p>
<p><img src="cg_2kids.jpg" width="366" height="278" align="right" />Are
  you lonely and sad on the playground, tired of practicing the choking game
  all by yourself? Nothing's stopping you from forming a choking club in your
  school, church group or community youth center. Set up an intramural Cholympics,
  even -- or solicit volunteers for a donation foundation like <i>Chokes For
  Strokes And Just Plain Folks</i>.
  Online resources normally intended for concerned parents can help preadolescents <b>easily</b> spot
  fellow choking chums from across a crowded little league field! Here's what
  to look for in a potential partner:</p>
<p>1. Unexplained marks or bruises on the neck.<br >
2. Blood-shot eyeballs.<br >
3. Constant complaints about "headaches".<br >
4. Disorientation after spending time alone.<br >
5. Unusual demands for privacy or locked doors.</p>
<p><img src="cg_play.jpg" width="312" height="278" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />Sounds like every suburban soccer mom in town! <i>Everyone's</i> passed out
  around here! You can also use your family's home computer to locate new friends.
  On message boards across the country, innovative American youth regularly come
  together to share unique tips and tricks which make the choking game more interesting,
  more exciting, and ten times more in-your-face, señor dude with a 'tude! Like <b>Ferek420,</b> who
  anonymously posts instructions for those who "want to not die". Let's
  read. <br >
  <br > 
  1. Lay down Flat on your back.<br >
  2. Have your "Spotter" grab
  your neck inner wrist to inner wrist applying pressure only to the jugular
  vains NOT THE WINDPIPE!!!<br >
  3. Place your hand on the forearm of the spotter
  and grip it lightly.<br >
  4. The Spotter presses until they can feel the blood flow
restrict.<br >
5. When your hand drops the spotter MUST let go.<br >
6. Enjoy your Trip.</p>
<p>Thanks,  a big tip of the hat to Ferek420. And here's another great tip from
  Rad McAwesome, the Choking Chipmunk: <i>Always Clear Your Browser
  History!</i></p>
