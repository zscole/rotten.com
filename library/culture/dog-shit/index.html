<h1>Dog Shit</h1>

<p><img src="ds_ds_tract.jpg" width="400" height="280" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">No
  lengthy, philosophical examination of dog shit would be complete without first
  pondering  more existential questions like <i>why</i> dogs
  shit, and <i>how.</i> The answers may 
surprise and delight you. There are many interlocking components to the dog shit
  process. Food eaten by <a href="/library/bio/animals/gunther-iv/">a dog</a> (cupcakes, floppy disks, corn dogs, Vicodin)
  must first be <b>processed</b> into simpler, smaller elements suitable for
  delivery via the bloodstream to muscle
and fatty tissue in the canine's body.</p>
<p>The digestive system of your dog begins
      at the lips and finishes under the tail, at a puckering donut-shaped curiosity
  scientists have nicknamed <b>the anus. </b>When you see a dog (or cat) who
  appears to be licking his or her own balls, it's more likely the animal is
  suffering from <b>anal gland disease.</b> Both
  the external anal sphincter and anal sac can become impacted or infected as
  the result of contaminants left behind by the anus, leading to feelings of
  pain and pressure best relieved by several hours of enthusiastic licking. The
  domesticated dog's alternative to licking is <img src="ds_ds_anus2.jpg" width="381" height="278" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">the
  act of <b>scooting</b> or <i><b>scootching</b></i> --
  sliding one's anus across a coarse or thickly carpeted floor to soothe "itchy" feelings
near the tail and hindquarters. Another reason for licking and scooting might
  be <b>worms,</b> a subject beyond the range of this modest tutorial. For those interested in further study, putting dog shit under a microscope
  can yield a full afternoon of excitement and wonder. <b>Monocystis sporocysts</b> are
  wiggly, protozoan parasites  visible in the feces of dogs who have
  eaten infected earthworms.</p>
<p>Cells in a dog's body naturally generate waste by-products which must
  be eliminated through the kidneys, the lungs, the skin and digestive system.
  These organs are part of a larger <b>excretory
        system. </b> Of course, not everything a dog eats can be digested properly,
        or even used to store energy. The unwanted digestive material left behind
        on city sidewalks and community <img src="ds_parade.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">dog
        parks is called <b>feces</b> in America,
        and <b><i>faeces</i></b> to those residing in 
        the United Kingdom, Ireland, Wales, or Scotland.</p>
<p>In Sydney, Australia, one can find over 100 tons of fresh dog shit dumped
  on the ground each day. Rich in phosphorous, Australian dog shit washes down
  hills after torrential rains, killing plant life.</p>
<p>There used to be an old joke: <i>How do you tell an American in Paris? He's
    the one picking the shit up after his dog.</i> Americans stopped picking
    up dog shit a long time ago, preferring instead to <b>pantomime</b>  picking
    up dog shit when witnesses at the dog park are present but
    <i>still too far away</i> to see if there's really anything in
    your hand. It's been universally acknowledged that <b>France</b> has the
    worst metropolitan dog shit problem. Each day, Parisian sidewalks, alleys
    and gutters are choked to excess with ten tons of golden brown, oven-baked
    baguettes left behind by the city's 200,000 dogs. It's been estimated that
    in a single year, six hundred people
      break a limb after slipping on French dog shit -- and in recent years,
      failure-to-pick-up fines have grown to <b>five hundred dollars</b> per
    loaf.</p>
<p><img src="ds_cleaner.jpg" width="300" height="225" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">And
  yes, in France there really is a <b>Dog Shit Patrol:</b> a subclass of
  the Parisian police force which manifests itself in a brigade of sixty-or-so
  green lawnmower motorcycles. These patrol vehicles search and scan for errant
  piles, circumnavigating city streets deemed most popular by tourists and
  politicians. Meanwhile, obese dogs are rapidly catching up to overweight French
  kids, with their sagging stomachs and bulging sides capable of depositing increasingly
  larger and more voluminous pockets of dog shit.</p>
<p>Every few months, dog shit gets tracked in by the news. Investigators
  discover "rooms
  filled with dog feces" in homes where neglected, emaciated children await
  rescue. Hundreds of animals are liberated from "cages lined with filthy
  dog droppings," in the homes of animal hoarders. Inevitably, whenever
  police storm into a person's home and encounter piles of garbage, the chances
of discovering "piles of dog shit" are exponentially increased. </p>
<p><img src="ds_ds_001.jpg" width="404" height="305" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">If
  you're an animal hoarder who resides in a rural apartment complex with a strict
  no-dogs-allowed policy, you can still get several hundred <b>fake dogs. </b>In
  its first week on the U.S. market, the Nintendo corporation sold a quarter-million
  units of <i>Nintendogs: </i>small, handheld devices which simulate the high-polygon
  dog ownership experience while tastefully eliminating the need for mylar poo
  bags.</p>
<p>If the idea of feeding, walking, and playing with fake dogs doesn't tickle
  your fancy, maybe you'd prefer a house full of <b>fake dog shit,</b> which
  comes in a variety of shapes. Machine-molded plastic dollops and rubberized
  poostuffs are key staples of novelty shops around the world. This "gag" gift
  makes it possible for apartment dwellers (or the financially disadvantaged)
  to circumvent traditional health code regulations and simulate the everyday
  presence of dogs in their homes or offices. Fake dog shit <b>really fills the
  void.</b> </p>
<p><img src="ds_ds_fakedogpoo.jpg" width="250" height="250" align="left">A softer, suppler variant of plastic dog shit can be created with organic
  ingredients right in your own kitchen. Just ask Hollywood prop master Mark
  Jameson, who was charged with just such a task when actors in <i>The 'Burbs</i> (Tom
  Hanks, 1989) complained they didn't want to step in the real thing: "We
  had a mixture of canned dog food, bean dip, and various other nasty-looking
  food items. After mixing the concoction, we loaded it into empty caulking tubes
  and squeezed it out where needed. It placed a perfectly-shaped dropping."</p>
<p><b>Dateline Germany, January 2005. </b>Police in the sleepy hamlet of Bayreuth
  are in a bit of a pickle. Someone -- <i>or something</i> -- is jamming <b> miniature
  toothpick flag portraits</b> of
  U.S. President <a href="/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George W Bush</a> into piles of dog shit  on sidewalks, public
  parks, and pedestrian thoroughfares. Josef Oettl, parks administrator for Bayreuth,
  said: "This
  has been going on for about a year now, and there must be <i>2,000 to 3,000</i> piles
of excrement that have been claimed during that time."</p>

  <img src="ds_bushdog.jpg" width="340" height="397" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">The
  dog-shit-on-a-stick motif was originally thought to be some sort
  of <i>protest</i> against
     the US-led invasion of Iraq. When the structures survived  for
  several consecutive seasons (weathering rain, snow, and extreme temperatures
  in all directions) the flags were thought to be a protest against Bush's campaign
  for re-election.</p>
<p>In
    2006, the dog shit Bush parade is <b>still
     going strong. </b>Police say they are completely baffled as to who
     might be responsible.</p>
<p>"We
  have sent out extra patrols to try to catch whoever is doing this in the act," said
     police spokesman Reiner Kuechler. "But frankly, we don't know what
     we would do if we caught them red handed."</p>
<p>Legal experts claim there's
       no law against using dog shit as a flag stand, although Federal legal
 analysts warn the Constitution is vague on the issue. One possible source
  of all the dog shit flags has been identified only as the <b>makeyouthink</b> online
  entity, which offers downloadable PDF templates for printing, folding, and
  concealing in a backpack.</p>

  To be sure, dog shit is annoying and problematic in every country -- but
    is it <i>really</i> subject matter capable of depositing a  huge, flaming
      bag of controversy on the entire world's doorstep?<br>
  <br>
  <b><img src="ds_dogshitgirl.jpg" width="350" height="488" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Dateline
  Korea, June 2005. </b>A
  young woman sits on a commuter train, protectively clutching a fluffy, miniaturized
  pet canine. Dogs <i>are</i> allowed on Korean subways, but dog bathrooms
    are not. Long story short: for lack of more comfortable accommodations, the
  dog was improvisationally compelled to take a big ol' <b>shitzu</b> --
    all spluttery, and with a lot of fanfare -- right on the rubberized linoleum
    floor of the subway car, to the horrified stares and glares of fellow subway
  passengers. See in the background, how all the onlookers appear to register
  differing levels of disgust and despair? Listen to eyewitness testimony
  (sourced by <i>Migukin</i> editor Shelton Bumgarner) from one passenger known
  only as <b>Miss
  Kim: </b></p>
<p><i>The dog pooped right next to the old man and [the girl] was embarrassed
    so she said to dog, "What's wrong? You have not done that before!" She
  had many bags to carry so she was embarrassed. She didn't know what to
  do at the time. So my girlfriend took out a tissue from her bag and gave it
  to her and the old man, me and my girlfriend, gave her some space. She said
  thank you. </i><i>And she sat down and <b>cleaned the dog's anus</b> with
  the tissue. </i><i>I was ten meters distance from her. "Hey, you have
  to clean the poop, too. If you bring the dog, you have to be responsible for
  that," I
  yelled at her.</i></p>

<br clear=all>
<p><i><img src="ds_cleanup.jpg" width="350" height="419" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">From that
    time, people started paying attention to her. The ajumma </i>[old woman]<i> who
    was near her, said, "Hey, you have to clean! Clean! Clean the poop!" The
    ajumma pushed and threw a red rag at her to use to clean.</i></p>
<p><i>I took out my camera
      and I was taking pictures and pushing her to clean the poop, but she didn't
      say anything. She was just looking at her dog and petting it. The subway
      way train got to Ahyun Station and when the doors open, she got off. At that
      time, she said something rude to the ajumma.</i></p>
<p>Miss Kim,  armed with digital <i>and</i> cellular photography
  equipment, snapped several<b> quick pictures</b> of the offending scene, making
  sure the girl's face was as visible as the dog shit, and extending the narrative
  pastiche to include other subway patrons begrudgingly cleaning up the dog shit
  for her. When Miss Kim returned home, she uploaded the images to her personal
  website, where they existed for many weeks accompanied by exactly the sort
  of "outrageous,
  what kind of ridiculous <a href="/library/bio/black-sheep/paris-hilton/">Paris Hilton</a> world are we all living in" text
  one might glance at briefly in a blog but never actually read.</p>
<p>But people <i>did</i> read, and yes, they were furious. How can you <b>not</b> want
  to rub her nose in it? The image
  was instantly popular, sparking a nation-wide dog shit hunt. The girl
  in the photograph became the subject of one of the earliest Internet
  memes in Eastern history, and quickly earned a new nickname: <i>Gae-Ttong-Nyue,</i> or "puppy
  poo girl" -- encouraging the Western translation of <b>Dog Shit
Girl. </b>Viewers zoomed in on portions of the image: the
dog, the bag, the girl's watch. Within days, she would be found and "punished"
by an online mob, with a campaign of ridicule, harassment, impenetrable
JPEG parodies, shaming techniques and all-out intimidation.</p>

<p><img src="ds_bwshit.jpg" width="350" height="303" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">She
  was treated like a public enemy, according to the <i>JoongAng Daily</i>. Internetters
   began visiting the Web site of the university they assumed she attended, and
  bombarded it with posts, effectively crashing the server. When an administrative
  staff member finally saw a photo of the Dog Shit Girl, it was determined there
  was no such student in the university's records. Nevertheless, the young woman
  was eventually forced to capitulate with an online apology, which in time made
  the whole thing blow over:</p>
<p><i>"I know I was wrong, but you guys are so harsh. I'm regret it, but I
  was so embarrassed so I just wanted to leave there. I was very irritable because
  many people looked at me and pushed me to clean the poop. Anyhow, I'm
  sorry. But, if you keep putting me down on the Internet I will sue all the
  people and at the worst I will will commit suicide. So please don't do
that anymore."</i></p>
<p>It should be noted that <i>The Washington Post</i> did not have the courage
  to call Dog Shit Girl by her full and complete alias, preferring instead to
  call her <i>Dog <b>Poop</b> Girl</i>.</p>
<p><img src="ds_kid_shit.jpg" width="388" height="297" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Dog
  shit, dog shit, look at all the dog shit. What if <i>people</i> did that?
  What if <i>human beings</i> just left shit and piss all over the sidewalk?
  Can you imagine <b>that</b> crazy
  alternate upside-down backwards reality? Well, of course that's
  exactly what babies <i>are</i> doing all over our poor Mother Earth. There's <i>shit
  everywhere,</i> folks-- <b>dog
  and otherwise. </b>Nobody wants to talk about it, but human beings are increasingly
mirroring the behavior of canines. </p>
<p>Ever heard of <i>Chinese mud flaps?</i> Sure you have: they're snug, split-open
  half-pants which allow toddlers in China, India, and Kenya to run around naked
  from the waist down, dongs flapping in the breeze and buttocks exposed. When
  it's time for these kids to <b>take a shit,</b> they can do so quickly
  and easily -- even when they're right in the middle of playing jump rope! Chinese
  mud flaps also simplify the process of helping a young one squat over a hole,
  a common sight in regions of China unencumbered by modern architecture. Can
  Western civilization be far... <i>"behind"</i>? </p>
<p><img src="ds_diapers.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Take
  a moment or two to recover from that joke, and then consider a report by Aimee
  Green in <i>The Oregonian</i>, who cites similarities between the world of
  dog shit and the world of people shit. Kelia Rawlinson is one of many 
  new-wave mothers who believe, "Our culture is inclined to tell you you've
  got to wait for your children to pee or poop on themselves and go clean them
  up. But why make them pee and poop on themselves? They're not born to want
  to do that -- really what happens is, they end up marinating in it."</p>
<p>And now you can get Chinese mud flaps for your <b>dog,</b> so <b>he</b> can
    shit everywhere without getting <b>his</b> pants dirty! <i>What a country!</i> Everywhere
    you look, every time you turn around, it all comes back to dog shit.</p>
<p><img src="ds_fudge.gif" width="239" height="330" align="left">Experts agree:
  it's an annoying, disgusting problem. While it hasn't exactly started World
  War III, one is still forced to wonder: is there <i>anything</i> good
  about dog shit?</p>
<p>Well, certainly
  when trod upon at the scene of a crime, police can examine or identify 
  footprints, tire tracks, and threaded bicycle trails by closely examining a
  pile of dog shit. And surely to some extent it could be collected <i>en masse</i>  by
  special interest groups and used to fertilize the White House rose garden.
  And is it any wonder that some of the world's most popular snack treats are
  coiled, curly-cued, or otherwise fashioned in proud dollops which resemble
  the substance? It's true! <b>You're
  the man now, dog shit. </b></p>
<p><img src="ds_softserve.jpg" width="240" height="320" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Lift
  the self-service lid of a Safeway snack bucket and see what you come up with.
  Yogurt-covered clusters, chocolate-drenched nut clumps, and misshapen carob-coated
  marshmallows melting in the noonday sun, to observe just a few. Ironically,
  it must be reported that none of these treats should ever be fed to your dog.</p>
<p>And
    look at those lincoln-log-shaped peanut butter filled pretzels sprinkled
  with enormous salt crystals like the kind you'd see in the laboratory of a
  sewage treatment plant. Christ, they're awful. So are <i>Cheetos™</i> Cheese
  Puffs which quite frankly mirror the individually placed, cylindrical
  cross-sectionals of orange dog shit stiffening on the lawn after several days
  of exposure.</p>
<p> Softly served ice cream treats such as the kind dispensed at fast
  food restaurants like Dairy Queen or Foster's Freeze are not above an appropriate
  level of comparison, either. And never one to eschew obfuscation, the <a href="/library/crime/corporate/mcdonalds/">McDonald's</a>
  restaurant corporation strictly insists all their frosty dog shit swirls be
  referred to as <i>kiddie cones</i> in
  store menus, drive-thru windows and <a href="/library/bio/pornographers/larry-flynt/">braille supplements</a> throughout North America.</p>
