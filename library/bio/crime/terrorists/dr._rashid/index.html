<H1>Dr. Rashid</H1>
<h2>aka Clement Rodney Hampton-El</h2>

<img src="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/dr._rashid/hampton-el-1.jpg" height="319" width="275" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>

<P>Clement Rodney Hampton-El, better known as Dr. Rashid, was a
strange cross between <a href="/library/culture/batman/">Batman</a>, <a href="/library/bio/religion/mother-teresa/">Mother Teresa</a> and <a href="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/ramzi-yousef/">Ramzi Yousef</a>. 
</P>
<P>Terrorists are generally a weird bunch, but Rashid ranks up there
as one of the weirdest. His story is almost whimsical, or it would
be, if not for the fact it ends with a failed plot to blow up New
York City tunnels and landmarks with truck bombs. 
</P>
<P>Born in 1938, young Clement was raised by his parents as a
God-fearing member of the <a href="/library/religion/moorish_science_temple_of_america/">Moorish
Science</a> church, a weird forerunner of the Nation of Islam. As a
member of the Moorish Temple, he wore a fez and proclaimed his belief
in black empowerment via flaky New Age beliefs purportedly somehow
connected to Islam. 
</P>
<P>Hampton-El joined the Army in 1957, but it didn't suit him very
well. He found racism to be rampant among his fellow soldiers. Flaky
beliefs or not, Moorish Science adherents were not known to accept
racial harassment meekly. Things boiled over. 
</P>

<blockquote><tt>"Finally, some guys came into the barracks and they said,
'You know, you're a dead nigger.' I thought they was just saying a
lot of crap, you know."</tt></blockquote>

<P>They weren't. Hampton-El was jumped by his fellow soldiers. He
fought back but got knocked out. When he woke up, he was in the
stockade. Since he was black and his assailants were white,
Hampton-El ended up getting a dishonorable discharge (which he later
successfully appealed). 
</P>

<img src="/library/religion/moorish_science_temple_of_america/moorish2.jpg" height="402" width="496" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>


<P>On leaving the Army, he went to work as an EMT, eventually taking
a job at the Long Island Hospital in New Jersey, where he would work
for nearly 30 years. He worked in the hospice wing, where he provided
care to terminally ill patients. His fellow employees saw him as an
unusually gentle and caring man, who was willing to do dirty jobs
like cleaning up patients who had shat themselves. 
</P>
<P>In 1967, Hampton-El was walking near his home in Brooklyn, when he
noticed a group of Muslims standing outside a mosque on State Street,
laughing at his fez. He asked them what they were laughing at, and
they told him "What
you are practicing is not really true Islam." 
</P>
<P>Clement came back the
next day and began studying Islam at the mosque. He adopted the
Islamic name Abdul Rashid Abdullah, but he went by Rashid. 
</P>
<P>Rashid was considered a
community leader. He was widely respected by his neighbors and
well-regarded at the mosques where he worshiped. He was deeply
involved in community affairs, at the mosque and his apartment
project, where he helped organize efforts to drive out drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>Unlike your typical
"crime watch," however, Rashid was active in his efforts. A
student of martial arts, Rashid patrolled the streets dressed in a
ninja costume, supposedly chasing down crack dealers and protecting
the innocent. 
</P>
<P>But it wasn't all
super-heroics and caring for the terminally ill. Rashid had a lot of
other stuff going on too. In 1988, for instance, he took a trip to
Pakistan and Afghanistan, to volunteer his services as a <I>mujahideen</I>
in the jihad against the Soviet Union. He made his arrangements
through the Alkifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>Officially, Alkifah was
a branch of the Services Office, a Pakistan-based operation designed
to raise funds and volunteers for the U.S. funded jihad. Because the
war in Afghanistan was a <a href="/library/conspiracy/cia/">CIA</a> pet
project, Alkifah didn't get a lot of scrutiny from law enforcement or
intelligence services, even when it sponsored seminars featuring
self-professed terrorists as keynote speakers. 
</P>



<P>The Brooklyn office
arranged for Rashid to meet up with the <I>mujahideen</I>
on his arrival in Pakistan. When he arrived, the jihadists he met
wanted to sign him up for <a href="/library/conspiracy/al-qaeda-and-the-assassins/mind-control/">religious
indoctrination</a> and combat training, but Rashid explained he only
had a month off from his job, so he needed to wade right on out into
the holy war. Fortunately, he explained, he had already been trained
in combat by the U.S. Army, so he didn't need to train. 
</P>


<img src="/library/conspiracy/al-qaeda-and-the-assassins/mind-control/assassins2-camp3.jpg" height="170" width="229" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>


<P>Later, prosecutors would argue that Rashid received actually did
attend training in Afghanistan, specifically on the topic of
bomb-making (Rashid denied this and said he spent his first few weeks
in Pakistan bedridden with a case of malaria). Either way, most
accounts agree that Rashid
served the jihad as a battlefield medic (who only incidentally
carried a rocket launcher, he explained later). 
</P>
<P>His compatriots called
him "Dr. Rashid," a nickname that stuck when he returned to
the States. 
</P>
<P>After about a week of
action, Rashid stepped on a landmine and blew half his leg off. He
raided his medical pack to stop the bleeding, then waited nearly 18
hours before he was evacuated from the battle scene to a Saudi-funded
hospital in Peshawar. 
</P>
<P>He returned to the
United States for more hospital care. Despite his short tenure in
Afghanistan, Rashid had apparently become a major <I>mujahideen
</I>celebrity. (The only account of his time in Afghanistan comes
from Rashid himself, so it's quite possible there were other reasons
for his celebrity status that have not been revealed to the public.) 

</P>
<P>After he emerged from
the hospital, Dr. Rashid was a much sought-after motivational
speaker. His talks dealt with devotion to Islam, liberally sprinkled
with exhortations to join the jihad. Rashid traveled around the
country, attending Islamic seminars and giving speeches at local
mosques. 
</P>
<P>His home base continued
to be Brooklyn, the Alkifah Center and a nearby mosque, Al-Farooq. As
the 1980s gave way to the 1990s, big changes were taking place within
Dr. Rashid's Brooklyn Muslim community. 
</P>



<img src="/library/conspiracy/al-qaeda-and-the-assassins/missing-link/assassins-rahman.jpg" height="241" width="180" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>


<P>In 1990, Sheikh Omar
Abdel Rahman arrived in New York. Known as the "blind sheikh,"
the visually impaired Rahman was a fiery fundamentalist preacher with
ties to three major Egyptian militant groups - Al-Gama'a
al-Islamiyya, the <a href="/library/conspiracy/muslim-brotherhood/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> and <a href="/library/history/terrorist-organizations/egyptian-islamic-jihad/">Egyptian Islamic Jihad</a>,
a terrorist network controlled by <a href="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/ayman-al-zawahiri/">Ayman Al-Zawahiri</a>. Rahman was a
notorious firebrand, who was tried and acquitted of providing a
<a href="/library/religion/fatwas/">fatwa</a> authorizing the assassination of Egyptian president
Anwar Sadat in 1981. Given his terrorist connections, Rahman's entry
into the U.S. was something of a mystery. Rumors swirled that his
efforts to obtain a visa were assisted by the CIA. 
</P>
<P>Rahman became the imam
of the al-Farooq mosque where Rashid worshiped. An extreme
fundamentalist trained in <a href="/library/history/countries/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a> and at Egypt's <a href="/library/conspiracy/al-qaeda-and-the-assassins/missing-link/">Al-Azhar University</a>, Rahman proved
immediately divisive in the community, preaching against Western
governments and ostracizing Brooklyn Muslims who sold unclean goods
(like pork and porn) to corrupt infidel New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>Rahman seized control of
the Alkifah Center in 1991, when its previous leader was brutally
assassinated. Officially, the murder remains unsolved, but it's
widely believed that Shalabi was killed on orders from Rahman, who
took control of the center's considerable finances and overseas
connections. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Rashid was close to
Rahman, and they traveled together to speak at Islamic conferences in
such locations as Detroit, <a href="/library/history/terrorist-organizations/b-i-f/">Chicago</a> and Oklahoma City. 
</P>


<img src="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/dr._rashid/hampton-el-nosair.jpg" height="281" width="200" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>



<P>When he wasn't busy
preaching, Rashid was preparing for the future. Starting in 1989,
Rashid and other radical Islamist began a rigorous program of jihad
training, purportedly for volunteers in Afghanistan and Bosnia (where
a new jihad was in its early stages). Rashid and other Brooklyn
Muslims trained in firearms use at a rifle range in New Jersey, and
in guerrilla techniques at a rural camp in central Pennsylvania. The
FBI monitored this activity but did nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>It's likely that some of
the trainees were already formally part of a <a href="/library/conspiracy/al-qaeda-and-the-assassins/agents-of-islam/">terrorist sleeper cell</a> by the time Rahman arrived on the
scene, but the "blind Sheikh" galvanized their activities
into formal operations. One of the men who trained with Rashid was El
Sayyid Nosair, a volunteer at the Alkifah center. Nosair had
emigrated to the U.S. from Egypt in the mid-1980s, along with several
other terrorist sleeper agents linked to Zawahiri. 
</P>
<P>The first operation
carried out by the cell was the assassination of right-wing rabbi
Meir Kahane by Nosair. Kahane was an outspoken advocate of deporting
all Palestinians out of Israel and he called for the institution of a
Jewish theocracy. Nosair shot Kahane in the head during a speech in
front of a packed audience of hundreds of people, then shot his way
down the street during an escape attempt. 
</P>
<P>Unbelievably, despite an
excessive amount of shooting and a room full of witnesses, Nosair was
acquitted of the murder and received a relatively short sentence for
a federal firearms violation. 
</P>
<P>It later emerged that
Dr. Rashid was originally supposed to be Nosair's getaway driver, but
he refused to appear on the scene, citing the fact that the FBI had
him under close surveillance. Later, Rashid reportedly berated
himself for not taking the job, considering that Nosair nearly
escaped even without assistance. A driver would likely have made the
difference. 
</P>
<P>Although Nosair had been
caught, it had little impact on the Brooklyn cell's operations. The
FBI had seized cartons of documents from his apartment, but never
bothered to translate them from the original Arabic. Had they done
so, they would have found clues to proposed terror plots all around
the city. They would also have found a document referring to a
previously unknown terror organization called "The Base,"
or in Arabic, <a href="/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">al Qaeda</a>. 
</P>

<img src="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/osama-bin-laden/199891.2.jpg" height="270" width="396" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>


<P>As the Afghanistan jihad
wound down at the end of the 1980s, Alkifah had begun to do more and
more business on behalf of al Qaeda, and its wealthy Saudi leader,
<a href="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/osama-bin-laden/">Osama bin Laden</a>. By the time Dr. Rashid made arrangements to go
to Pakistan, al Qaeda was well on its way to becoming the dominant
force at the center. 
</P>
<P>Several of the Alkifah
Center's "volunteers" were tied to bin Laden and al Qaeda
(including Wadih El-Hage, bin Laden's personal secretary, and Ali
Mohammed, bin Laden's chief of security), but the U.S. government
didn't even know the terror network's name. If they had bothered to
translate Nosair's material, and follow up on the leads contained
within, they might have been prepared for Ramzi
Yousef's arrival in Brooklyn in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>Yousef had been summoned
to New York from Pakistan by the blind sheikh. Yousef's work in New
York was paid for in part by his uncle, <a href="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/mohammed-shaikh-khalid/">Khalid Shaikh Mohammed</a>,
and in part by bin Laden. On his arrival in the States, Yousef joined
forces with a cabal of Alkifah-linked terorrists, including Mahmud
Abouhalima, another associate of Dr. Rashid's. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Rashid himself was
only tangentially connected to Yousef's reason for being in New York,
a plot to bomb the <a href="/library/history/wtc/">World Trade Center</a>. But Rashid was not idle
during this time. 
</P>

<img src="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/ramzi-yousef/yousef1.jpg" height="250" width="182" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>



<P>After coming back from
Afghanistan, Dr. Rashid's career had proceeded on two fronts, neither
of which had anything to do with medicine. First, he had established
himself as a go-to guy for guns and other jihad supplies, such as
explosives and detonators. He paid for weapons from gun shows, local
stores and freelance sellers. In addition to his clients providing
"security" services at Brooklyn mosques and Alkifah, Rashid
made deals with al-Faruq, a clannish group of black separatist
Muslims with heavily armed rural compounds around the country. 
</P>
<P>Rashid's other business
was international. Toward the end of 1992, while Yousef was busy
building a truck bomb that would kill six and injure a thousand at
the WTC, Dr. Rashid was doing business on behalf of the Saudis. In
December 1992, Rashid went to the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C.,
where he met with high ranking Saudi government officials. 
</P>


<img src="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/ramzi-yousef/wtc1993.jpg" height="184" width="275" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>


<P>The Saudis had several
tasks for the Afghan veteran. Rashid met with a U.S. Marine sergeant
who gave him a list of servicemen who were about to rotate out of
active duty. Rashid was ordered to recruit terrorists and trainers
from the list, some of whom were slated to fight in Bosnia, where al
Qaeda was trying to jumpstart a revolution. At one point, Rashid
claimed he had thousands of names in his recruitment list, many of
which appear to have been collected by the Saudi government during
the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>The Saudis had other
jobs for Rashid as well. Early in 1993, while Yousef was blowing up
the World Trade Center, Rashid was traveling to Europe where he would
ferry large amounts of cash back to the U.S. from wealthy Saudi
donors who were trying to protect their identities. Some of the money
went to fund terrorist training and operations on U.S. soil, some of
it was earmarked for Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>In May, Rashid traveled
to Saudi Arabia in person, then to the Philippines, where he attended
a symposium sponsored by the Islamic Da'wa Council of the
Philippines, a charitable organization that Philippines authorities
say was linked to bin Laden's brother-in-law, <a href="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/mohammed-jamal-khalifa/">Mohammed Jamal Khalifa</a>, a Saudi businessman who is alleged to have acted as a top
al Qaeda financier. While in the Philippines, Rashid learned about
terrorist training camps in the south of the country. When he came
back to the U.S., he told his friends that he was planning to move to
the Philippines and take part in jihad there. Some of them asked to
join him. 
</P>
<P>Before they left,
however, there was one more job to do in the United States. 
</P>
<P>In the wake of the World
Trade Center bombing in February 1993, several members of the
Brooklyn sleeper cell had been arrested or forced to flee the
country. The remaining terrorists were determined to follow up on
Yousef's opening salvo. 
</P>

<img src="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/dr._rashid/hampton-el-unitednations.jpg" height="236" width="250" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>



<P>The plot was ambitious.
The cell wanted to create a "Day of Terror," with a series
of near-simultaneous bombings across New York City. At various
stages, the plot looked at tunnels, federal buildings, courthouses
and the United Nations as targets. The final list was narrowed down
to five, including the U.N., the Holland Tunnel, the Lincoln Tunnel,
the George Washington Bridge and the Manhattan Federal Building,
which housed the FBI's New York offices. It would be a highly
synchronized attack, a style now considered an al Qaeda trademark. 
</P>
<P>The remaining cell
members included Siddig Ali, Ibrahim El-Gabrowny, Tarig Elhassen,
Mohammed Saleh, and dozens of others associated with the Brooklyn
mosque. Only a dozen men were prosecuted for the plot, but a list of
unindicted co-conspirators included 172 more names, including Osama
bin Laden, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, and the diplomatic attache from the
Sudan (where bin Laden lived).
</P>
<P>Dr. Rashid's job was to
obtain supplies for the plot, including weapons, explosives and
detonators. Although hundreds of pages of testimony cited dozens of
discussions by the conspirators regarding Rashid's quest to find
detonators and other materials for the bomb, it was never clear what
material he actually provided to the plotters, if any. 
</P>
<P>Rashid was also believed
to have provided some expertise in bomb-building, but the plotters
were also supplied with a variety of instruction manuals on the
subject, some of which had been purchased at <a href="/library/culture/turner-diaries/">U.S. gun shows</a>. Several members of the cell assembled in a
storage locker in New Jersey to start building the bombs, which used
components such as homemade nitroglycerin, ammonium nitrate and fuel
oil. The bombs would be delivered in stolen cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>Several of the New York
operatives rented a storage space in Queens to prepare their bomb.
But for all their preparation, they had failed to obtain one crucial
piece of information -– the fact that one of their
co-conspirators was actually an FBI informant. The storage space had
been wired for sound and video, and the informant had been secretly
taping the plotters for months. At 2 a.m. on June 24, 1993, five of
the plotters were arrested as they mixed fertilizer and fuel oil for
their bombs. 
</P>
<P>Dr. Rashid was not on
the scene, but he was arrested early the next morning, outside his
apartment. 
</P>

<img src="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/terry-nichols/okc2.jpg" height="292" width="431" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10>

<P>As a problem in
prosecution, the plot was a slam dunk. Thanks to the informant, the
FBI had hours and hours of tape, phone taps and physical evidence.
During the 1995 trial, in which all the defendents were prosecuted
together, Rashid's attorney repeatedly characterized the evidence
against his client as "bullshit." The hours of
incriminating conversation featuring his client were just "bullshit
sessions." (The word "shit" was used in some variation
more than 40 times during the trial.)
</P>
<P>The trial was not
without its complications. On April 19, 1995, Gulf War veteran
<a href="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/timothy-mcveigh/">Timothy McVeigh</a> blew up the Alfred E. Murrah Federal Building in
Oklahoma City. The truck bomb was very similar to the ones planned
for the Landmarks plot, the target was very similar, the New York
suspects had traveled to Oklahoma City and to Michigan, where McVeigh
and co-conspirator <a href="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/terry-nichols/">Terry Nichols</a> had lived, and Dr. Rashid had
traveled to the Philippines, where Nichols and Ramzi Yousef had both
spent several months in 1994. Both Nichols and McVeigh
had sold weapons at gun shows across the U.S., and the New York
suspects had bought weapons at similar shows. 
</P>
<P>Faced with all this, the court had to make a decision –-
complicate an already complicated case by declaring a mistrial and
waiting for possible new evidence, which might not ever surface, or
continue as if nothing had happened. 
</P>
<P>After several days of
lesser instructions, the judge announced to the jury on April 24: "I
think we already know enough about that matter to be able to say that
that bombing not only had absolutely nothing to do legally with this
case, but also in fact cannot possibly be connected in any way with
any defendant in this case." 
</P>
<P>It was an extraordinary
statement, considering that FBI agents were at that moment traipsing
around the Philippines interrogating Nichols' associates about his
possible connections to Islamic extremists. 
</P>
<P>There were other possibilities as well. Although it wasn't widely known at the time, Islamic evangelists working for the Saudi government had collected
the names of thousands of U.S. servicemen during the <a href="/library/history/war/gulf-war/">Gulf War</a>,
with the goal of converting them to Islam, as reported by the
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>Most of the names were
collected in Riyadh, where Timothy McVeigh had briefly been
stationed. The Saudi official in charge of the program distributed
the names to U.S. operatives who followed up with the soldiers. The
official who ran the Riyadh program was the same Saudi cleric who
provided Dr. Rashid with a list of former servicemen to recruit as
terrorist trainers. 
</P>

<img src="/library/bio/crime/terrorists/dr._rashid/hampton-el-harrelson.jpg" height="245" width="144" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10>


<P>Regardless of these bits
of trivia, the trial went on and the U.S. government never produced
evidence of a link between the two cases (whether or not such
evidence existed). Based on hours of surveillance tapes, copious
physical evidence and weeks of testimony by government informants,
the jury returned a round of guilty verdicts in October 1995. 
</P>

<P>Dr. Rashid, under his
birth name of Clement Rodney Hampton-El, was sentenced to 35 years in
prison, better than some of the defendants but worse than others. 
</P>

<P>Today, at age 66, Dr.
Rashid has traded his ninja superhero costume for a prison jumpsuit.
Rashid's sentence expires in 2023; he could conceivably live long
enough to see daylight again. 
</P>
<P>He lives out his days in
a tiny, restricted cell in Colorado's Supermax prison, one of the
most secure federal facilities in the country, alongside such
notorious criminals such as Ramzi Yousef, the <a href="/library/bio/crime/serial-killers/unabomer/">Unabomber</a>, Terry
Nichols and <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/actors/woody-harrelson/">Woody Harrelson's</a> dad (pictured at right). Which means he's keeping company with a <a href="/library/crime/terrorism/september_11/">September 11</a> conspirator, an Oklahoma City conspirator and an alleged <a href="/library/conspiracy/kennedy/">Kennedy Assassinations</a> conspirator.
</P>
<P>Woody Harrelson's dad was one of JFK's assassins? Even in prison, Dr. Rashid keeps some strange company...
