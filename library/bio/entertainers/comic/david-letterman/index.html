        Letterman began his career in broadcasting in Indianapolis, Indiana, working 
        as a weekend weatherman. In 1975, he moved to Los Angeles and wrote comedy, 
        appearing on <em>Mary Tyler Moore, The Gong Show, and $20,000 Pyramid</em>. 
        His stand-up routines alongside Jay Leno led to a 1978 appearance on <em>The 
        Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, </em>and ultimately Letterman's flagship 
        broadcast,<em> Late Night with David Letterman.</em> <br>
      </p>
            When Johnny Carson retired in 1991, 
      Letterman was astonished to learn the career he'd been eyeing his entire 
      life had been handed over to Jay Leno. To this day, <em>The Tonight Show</em> 
      and <em>Late Night</em> continue to steal bits from each other, but working 
      for <em>Late Night </em> is universally heralded as a comedian's dream job, 
      inspiring an incestuous group of writers and producers who share material 
      across Conan O'Brien, Craig Kilborn, <em>The Onion, <a href="/library/culture/the-simpsons/">The Simpsons</a>,</em> and 
      <em><a href="/library/culture/daily-show/">The Daily Show</a>.</em></td>

        Letterman's personal life. Often people extract what they can from stray 
        cameos in movies like Chris Elliot's <em>Cabin Boy</em>, where he played 
        a sarcastic villager who calls Chris Elliot "Jennifer". In films 
        like <em>Man On The Moon</em> and <em>Private Parts</em>, Letterman prefers 
        to appear as himself. To this day he remains intensely private, but periodically 
        leaks information during polite, intimate interviews. He has a fondness 
        for old British films - actress Myrna Loy in particular - and tales of 
        unrequited love. The original versions of <em>Goodbye, Mr. Chips</em> 
        and <em>The Ghost and Mrs. Muir</em> reduce him to tears.<em> Beavis 
        and Butthead</em> makes him howl with laughter.</p></td>

      Markoe. But instead of working on the show and returning home at the end 
      of the day to live some kind of life, they continued working on the show. 
      This led to friction.<br>
      <br>
         "Every day at work was a fistfight," recalls 
      Dave. "Every night at home was a fistfight. Figuratively speaking."<br>
      <br>
         Merrill moved all the way to New York for Dave, then later

    <td>   For a short while, Letterman had a drinking problem. 
      He grew uncomfortable around other people unless he was fall-down drunk. 
      He <a href="/library/crime/drugs/marijuana/">smoked pot</a> for six months. Dave remembers one night in particular when 
      he smoked a joint. He went downstairs and ended up devouring two pints of 
      Haagen-Dazs ice cream. Then he promptly went to bed. An hour later, he was 
      awakened by a "startling thump" in his chest, and he genuinely 
      believed his heart had stopped. The next afternoon at the cardiologist, 
      he admitted smoking pot, but didn't mention the ice cream.<br>
      <br>
         Dave monitors his weight carefully. When he moved to New 
      York, he weighed 173 pounds. His sophomore year in college, he weighed 153. 
      In 1994, he was shocked to learn he weighed 210. He took steps to slenderize, 
      but it was a difficult process. America watched his appearance change over 
      the course of many broadcasts. In January of 2000 David Letterman underwent 
      quintuple bypass surgery, and some say his attitude softened after surgery. 
      But he continues to appreciate fast cars. He's been awarded numerous speeding 
      tickets while en route from Connecticut to New York. <a href="/library/bio/entertainers/radio/howard-stern/">Howard Stern</a> likes 
      to give him a hard time about that.</td>

        Ray</strong> was a Connecticut woman with a long history of mental illness 
        and a rap sheet dating back to 1988. She wrote Dave a letter every day 
        for six years. She showered him with flowers, cookies, and empty Jack 
        Daniels bottles.<br>
        <br>
          "Sometimes three or four letters a day. And you can see, 
        when she's on medication she makes sense. She's an intelligent woman; 
        she just happens to be insane. When she goes off the medication, you get 
        reams of scrawl -- literally, scrawl."<br>

          Then she began circling in all the regular stalking patterns: 
        breaking into his home, puttering around in his tool shed and sleeping 
        in his tennis courts. She stole his Porsche, and when she found herself 
        unable to pay the $3 toll near the Lincoln Tunnel in New York, she was 
        arrested. Ray identified herself as Letterman's wife and the mother of 
        their (nonexistent) child. "I love him and want to spend the rest 
        of my life with him," she said from jail. She spent 10 months in 
        prison and 14 months in a mental institution.<br>
        <br>
          "The thing is, she's insane," Letterman told a Connecticut 
        newspaper in 1992. "And you don't want to do anything to make it 
        worse than it is."<br>

          Ray would be arrested seven more times for Letterman-related 
        antics before shifting the focus of her adoration to retired astronaut 
        Story Musgrave. She banged on his front door at 5:30 in the morning, and 
        then went around the house turning on all the water faucets. Weeks later, 
        Margaret Ray committed <a href="/library/death/suicide/">suicide</a> by kneeling in front of a train in Colorado.<br>

          Besides Margaret Ray, up to fifty other women have been known 
        to think Letterman speaks directly to them through the blue glow of their 
        television. Some wait for Dave outside the studio, others at his home. 
        One even managed to throw him up against a wall for a prolonged make-out 
        session. Less than a month after Ray's death, Letterman would have a new 
        stalker: Nellie Ruth Shirley, age 39. She was ordered to stay away.<br>
