<h1>Laura Schlessinger</h1>

First things first. Laura Schlessinger is neither a physician nor does she hold a PhD in her chosen profession. Therefore, she shouldn't be calling herself "doctor."
<p>

And talk about preachy. Hey, lady -- we've seen your self-rightous snatch and we're not impressed. Drop the fake "Doctor" title, get back in the kitchen and leave the poor homosexual community alone. You can replace your show with a Markov chain robot and nobody would fucking know the difference.
<p>

Laura got snagged for having fake guests on her short-lived TV show. One of her staffers, named San-D Duchac, made guest appearances in two consecutive episodes having different topics.

"Dr" Laura is not a psychologist nor a psychiatrist. Her doctorate is in Physiology only. She is also a licensed MFCC (Marriage, Family, Child Counselor) but not a psychologist. This has been a great misconception of Laura Schlessinger which she has in many ways been willing to perpetuate and exploit. Even in her TV listings she is being called a Psychotherapist, which is totally inaccurate.

<blockquote>
<p>MM: You spoke earlier of being a poster girl. Is it true you have a framed picture of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor from <i>The Terminator</i>?</p>

<p>SCHLESSINGER: Connor's my hero. I told my trainer, "I want to look like her." I also like the way she's there to protect her son and the world. She's strong, she's passionate, she fights for right. My dream is for Arnold Schwarzenegger to ask me to play her in <i>Terminator 3</i>. The only other role I'd want to play is Ripley in the first <i>Alien</i> -- minus that little underwear scene at the end.</p>

"If you're gay or lesbian, it's a biological error that inhibits you from relating normally to the opposite sex. The fact that you are intelligent, creative and valuable is all true. The error is in your inability to relate sexually intimately, in a loving way to a member of the opposite sex."

"When an individual is not drawn to a member of the opposite sex, in biology that's called an error."

"Feminism today has become something very strange. The proof of the pudding is that I'm not on the cover of <i>Ms.</i> magazine. I am educated, accomplished, married; my family is first, yet I've still managed to do important things in the world. I should be the poster girl for the feminist movement!"
</blockquote>
<p>

<blockquote><tt>
"My perspective of the biology of homosexuality is informed by a Ph.D. in physiology from Columbia University," said Schlessinger in May 2000 after a broadcast ethics organization condemned her show. "This degree entitles me to state the obvious: Homosexuality is a deviation from the biological norm of heterosexuality. Further, as an Orthodox Jew, I believe that same-sex sexual behavior is incompatible with Biblical scripture."

<p>

<blockquote>
TAE: The runaway success of pictures such as Toy Story, Shrek, Monsters, Inc., and The Rookie show that when Hollywood wants to, the industry can turn out smart, popular entertainment that's also morally wholesome. Why don't they do it more often?
<p>

SCHLESSINGER: Their impulse to spread vulgarity, violence, and mayhem can often be even greater than their interest in making money. 
<p>

TAE: I've read that you didn't always lead the kind of life you now advocate.
<p>

SCHLESSINGER: Don't believe everything you read. I was never far off from what I now advocate. Any little experimentation I did took about a year and a half out of a life that's 55 years old. That gets exaggerated and taken out of context in order to shoot the messenger.

I remember the '70s and '80s that the line was that this is only about sex, it's not about anything else, right? So what's the gay culture? Is that where we get into the promiscuity and the <a href="/library/sex/pedophilia/">pedophilia</a>? Or are these just regulation human beings, who somehow have an error in their sexual orientation but otherwise are seriously regulation human beings? I'm confused. First I'm told for 20 years that it’s only about sex. Now I’m told it's a whole culture. So what's in the culture? What is it? If it's just about sex, then the culture must only be about sex. Otherwise you’re American culture. But listen to this. <i>'They presented a slide show, Friday, during the school's popular culture assembly which also features dances from Polynesian, African and Latin countries.'</i> That's culture. Sexual deviations are not culture. They're sexual deviations."</font></td>

There are different ways to lie. This one is by distortion and misrepresentation. I have never called homosexuals errors. I have called the sexuality an error. ... I want you to know that Joan Garry completely misrepresented my presentation. I have never called a people an error. I have called the sexuality, orientation, an error.
