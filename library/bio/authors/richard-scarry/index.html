      <h1>Richard Scarry</h1>
      <p><i><img src="intro.jpg" width="380" height="322" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">"I'm 
        not interested in creating a book that is read once and then placed on 
        the shelf and forgotten. I am very happy when people have worn out my 
        books, or that they're held together by Scotch tape."</i></p>
      <p><b>Richard McClure Scarry</b> (1919 - 1994) revealed to children the 
        secrets of everyday life. His worlds were easily understood, populated 
        by polite, well-mannered animals with a keen eye 
        for absurd human behavior. Scarry himself bumbled his way through a charmed 
        life of good luck and fortunate circumstance, pretty much doing whatever 
        he liked until the day he died.</p>
      <p>First editions of his 19-cent books presently fetch hundreds of dollars. 
        He wrote and illustrated over three hundred major picture books for children, 
        each one dense with slapstick and visual humor. More than three hundred 
        million copies of his work have exchanged hands, some of which were translated 
        into thirty languages. This qualifies him to be the most popular children's 
        book author of all time, and it can be argued there are two types of people: 
        those who grew up reading Richard Scarry, and those who remain perpetually 
        maladjusted to society.</p>
      <p>R<img src="tail.jpg" width="200" height="187" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">ichard 
        Scarry hated school, and he never paid attention in class. He'd find slithering 
        garter snakes in the grassy courtyard and set them wriggling on smooth 
        tabletops at the library. He delighted in the terrified screams of little 
        girls. The head librarian screamed once or twice too often, and finally 
        she banished him from the library forever. That was the beginning of the 
        end for Richard, and his on again / off again love affair with traditional 
        education. A fitting irony, it can be acknowledged, that years later the 
        children's section of the Boston Public Library would be permanently stacked 
        full of his work, and extremely popular with troublemakers of equal or 
        greater attention deficit disorder.</p>
      <p><img src="eggs.jpg" width="337" height="188" align="right">The 
        young master Dick received D's and F's on homework assignments with such 
        regularity that his poor performance nearly caused him to drop out of 
        junior high. When he finally reached the upper grades, he often skipped 
        school to attend burlesque shows in downtown Boston's Scollay Square.</p>
      <p>Scarry <a href="/library/sex/virginity/">discovered</a> the mysteries of sex at a very early age. Perhaps too 
        early. To him, any girl who took off her clothes while slinking about 
        the stage was worthy of intense scrutiny. More so than Algebra, anyway, 
        which he was forced to repeat twice b<img src="kissing.jpg" width="218" height="187" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">efore 
        passing. During these mind-numbing extended math sessions, he practiced 
        copying his mother's handwriting in order to forge notes from home. <i>Dear 
        Miss O'Conner,</i> one note read. <i>Richard couldn't attend school yesterday. 
        He had a bad cough. Signed, Mrs. Scarry.</i> After his frequent absences 
        were finally tallied up, it took him five years to complete high school.</p>
      <p><img src="myson.jpg" width="250" height="138" align="right">He 
        drew countless pictures of one girl in particular (during his "alone 
        time") and inevitably these crude, charcoal nudie pics were discovered 
        by his parents. His father, a serious and conservative businessman, was 
        convinced his son's obsession with women, artwork, and ditching school 
        would lead to a sad, pathetic life in a attic, with nothing but canned 
        spaghetti for breakfast. One evening he seized one of Richard's early 
        illustrations - a half-naked girl swinging tassels from her nipples - 
        and confronted the boy directly: "What's going to become of you, 
        Richard?"<br>
        <br>
        <img src="blowing.jpg" width="225" height="197" align="left">"If 
        I'm going to be an artist, sir, I have to learn how to draw the human 
        form," came the reply.</p>
      <p>Possibly Richard needed a real father figure. Some kind of male influence 
        who could help him win as many girls as possible. He listened intently 
        to his Uncle Arthur, a white-haired, sun-tanned ladies' man kinda-guy 
        who lived in New York. Arthur told truly tall tales about the many women 
        who swooned for him, and Richard took to heart one piece of his uncle's 
        wisdom: "Buy a natural linen suit at Brooks Brothers, with a pale 
        blue shirt to wear under it. This is the only thing you need to learn 
        in life."</p>
      <p><img src="ties.jpg" width="299" height="185" align="right">Richard 
        purchased just such a suit, and paid for it by putting in long hours selling 
        neckties at his father's department store. Unfortunately, it failed to 
        impress the admissions officer at Harvard University, where his father 
        was hoping he'd enroll and eventually get accepted. Double-unfortunately, 
        Richard's grades had been terrible from the very start, and certainly 
        not ivy league material, to say the least.</p>
      <p><img src="jeep2.jpg" width="202" height="290" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">At 
        his father's request, Richard attended a local business college, but his 
        agonizing, indelible hatred for school compelled him to drop out before 
        the end of his first year. Eventually, his father gave up. He abandoned 
        any pretext of having control over Richard's mind, and shipped him off 
        to art school at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. And wouldn't you know it, 
        Richard flourished in the welcoming atmosphere of nude models, drawing 
        pencils, and paint. It was supposed to be a new start for the young man 
        - but <a href="/library/history/war/wwii/">World War II</a> broke out, ending his art studies permanently. One 
        year shy of graduation, Richard was drafted into the army. He would never 
        receive his diploma.</p>
      <p>O<img src="jeep.jpg" width="211" height="282" align="right">n 
        his first day of service, the army told him to list his occupations on 
        a questionnaire. When Richard scribbled the word <b>ARTIST,</b> he was 
        shipped off to radio repair school in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Goddamnit! 
        More fucking school! Jesus Christ! He failed the exam miserably, of course, 
        earning the unheard-of lowest score in the history of the class: minus 
        thirteen. The barracks were enormous and dismal, the lessons in proper 
        bedmaking ridiculous. His drill sergeant was loathsome. Learning how to 
        <i>walk</i> again, left - right - left - right. Richard had no idea how 
        his life had come to this.</p>
      <p>In no time at all, he was ordered to report to the major's office. Wondering 
        what he'd done wrong, Richard tried delivering a smart and snappy salute, 
        but he was so nervous <img src="artschool.jpg" width="250" height="136" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">his 
        hand trembled.</p>
      <p>"I see you're an artist, Scarry," said the major. "Can 
        you paint letters? A, B, C - that sort of thing?"</p>
      <p>"Yes, indeed, sir," Private Scarry answered.</p>
      <p>And so. Richard was assigned two sloppy buckets of paint, silver and 
        black, both thicker than tar. He flung the paints from their buckets and 
        spread them with a broom. He was ordered to paint a sign nearly thirty 
        feet long: <b>WELCOME TO THE SEVENTH ENGINEERS OF FORT MONMOUTH, NEW JERSEY.</b> 
        It was a task which could easily keep him busy for the entire war, but 
        after a few weeks the paint had dried. Dick's talents as an artist were 
        finally being recognized! By the United States military, no less!</p>
      <p><b><img src="tent.jpg" width="337" height="243" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></b>After 
        that, everything changed for Richard. While his less fortunate army buddies 
        were running laps with heavy backpacks in the hot sun, Richard g<img src="dancing.jpg" width="150" height="113" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">ot 
        weekly passes to take a bus to New York, where he'd dance with young women 
        at the U.S.O. Assigned to Special Services, Scarry relocated to Lee University 
        in Lexington, Virginia, a beautiful campus with <b><i>p-l-l-lenty</i></b> 
        of innocent, excitable girls in perpetual attendance from the nearby Red 
        Cross and the Nurses Corps. Not only that, he received a medical discharge 
        excusing him for from any strenuous physical activity. No forgery required 
        this time, it was like getting a ninety day vacation for free.</p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter, he was assigned the daunting task of being the military's 
        "art director". <img src="post.jpg" width="300" height="93" align="right">A 
        colonel from headquarters had informed him that his new job was to tell 
        the troops <b>why</b> they were fighting, and send them news from home. 
        Richard had no idea how he was meant to accomplish such a task. When he 
        asked the colonel how, the colonel shouted, "By post!" and slammed 
        the door behind him.</p>
      <p><img src="bonk.jpg" width="302" height="401" align="left">How 
        could an inexperienced young soldier like Richard Scarry possibly bolster 
        the morale of the entire American fighting force stationed around the 
        world? By plagiarizing <i>Time</i> magazine, of course. He had copies 
        flown in; he paraphrased the important parts, created some illustrations, 
        and turned it into a flier duplicated by mimeograph. It was the best assignment 
        he'd ever had, and soon he was editor and writer of Publications for the 
        Information and Morale Services Section of the Allied Force Headquarters. 
        This job gave him even <b>more</b> leisure time, enabling him to travel 
        around the world <img src="cafes.jpg" width="236" height="186" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"> 
        to Africa, Algiers, Italy, and France. He took long walks, sat in cafes, 
        studied ancient ruins, visited art museums and churches. The experience 
        instilled in him a great love of travel and foreign culture which would 
        later be reflected in his best-selling children's book <i>Busy Busy World.</i></p>
      <p>Scarry would later declare to his colleagues that World War II was - 
        in his opinion - the "best war ever".</p>
      <p>When Japan surrendered on August 14, 1945, World War II came to an end. 
        Richard was now a 27 year-old civilian who could honestly report he'd 
        had experience developing entertaining content for an audience of more 
        than one million readers each week. He looked forward to getting a "real" 
        job, and he was hired to work in the art department of <i>Vogue</i> magazine, 
        a Condé Nast publication. <b><i>Hooray!!</i></b></p>
      <p><img src="driver.jpg" width="270" height="206" align="right">Three 
        weeks later, he was fired. <font color="#999999" size="-2">D'oh.</font> 
        No reason was given, apart from the fact that Richard "just wasn't 
        right for the position." When he asked why they'd bothered to hire 
        him in the first place, the personnel officer said - no joke - that she'd 
        been impressed by his white linen suit and blue shirt.</p>
      <p>He found a small apartment in Manhattan's East Side, for which he paid 
        - again, no joke - fourteen dollars a month. During the mid 1940s, a person 
        could live on $1000 a year - and Richard lived well, despite being a child 
        of the Depression years. He secured a job in an advertising agency pasting 
        up photographs for layouts, but the work was uncreative and boring. He 
        lasted three months, eventually devoting himself to free-lance illustration. 
        He maintained an active social life, going to parties, good restaurants 
        and chasing after attractive young women. When Holiday magazine paid him 
        $2000 for a single assignment, he relocated to an even better bachelor 
        pad in Washington Square, where the <img src="pat1.jpg" width="272" height="265" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">cocktail 
        parties were nearly a hundred times more elaborate. It was in this neighborhood 
        that he met a particularly charming young lass by the name of Patsy Murphy, 
        who would later become his one and only wife. His days of womanizing were 
        over, and he proposed to her efficiently, by telegram:</p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">MUST MOVE GRAND PIANO. 
        HEAVY. NEED HELP. COME IMMEDIATELY. ...DICK</font></p>
      <p>If you can call that a proposal. Patsy and Richard were married September 
        11, 1948, and so intent was he on becoming a competent artist that his 
        personality began to change. He grew quiet and withdrawn, and he wasn't 
        much of a talker. Meanwhile, Patsy was outgoing, a drinker, a smoker - 
        very extroverted and gregarious. She loved entertaining, she loved people 
        and parties. It was a perfect arrangement; Patsy guided him through tedious 
        social engagements, often acting as a buffer between him and his publisher. 
        Scarry was turning into a disciplined worker, rising shortly before eight 
        each morning, and drawing in his studio until four in the afternoon. An 
        hour break for lunch. Patsy wasn't allowed to talk to him during this 
        time; she simply set a ham sandwich and pickles on his desk and went back 
        downstairs.</p>
      <p><img src="lumber.jpg" width="446" height="183" align="right">That 
        summer, he got his first big break. The Artists and Writers Guild, a small 
        editorial subsidiary in New York financed by the Western Printing Company 
        was producing mass-market activity books and games. One of their creations 
        were Little Golden Books, which sold for twenty-five cents each. After 
        Scarry submitted his portfolio - which at that time consisted mostly of 
        cartoonish human characters - they signed him to a one-year exclusive 
        services contract worth an astonishing $4800.</p>
      <p><img src="sob.jpg" width="200" height="156" align="left">It 
        wasn't until 1959 that his animal characters emerged as real people. <i>Naughty 
        Bunny</i> told the story of a little bunny who constantly tracked mud 
        all over the carpet and kept his room in a state of perpetual disaster, 
        driving his poor mother to tears. <img src="float.jpg" width="300" height="233" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">Scarry 
        wanted to create a different kind of world for children, one with equal 
        parts humor and pathos. He had a secret plan to develop a new kind of 
        dictionary which arranged words by categories instead of the alphabet. 
        This format would allow him to draw over fourteen hundred solo panels 
        of slapstick anthropomorphic behavior, introduce lots of new characters, 
        and write short amusing texts for each category. The result was <i>Richard 
        Scarry's Best Word Book Ever</i>, hardbound at 10.5 x 11.7 inches in oversized 
        format. It truly dwarfed all others, selling seven million copies in only 
        a few short years. The Scarry genius had broken loose.</p>
      <p>He didn't write stories, he drew them in pencil on frosted acetate. Then 
        he painted through the entire stack color by color. First he'd colorize 
        everything meant to be red, then blue, yellow, and so forth. He'd do all 
        the pigs, then all the cats, then all the dogs. He preferred a bright, 
        simple palette of Winsor & Newton Designers Colors: Flame Red, Carthamus 
        Pink, Cadmium Orange and Primrose, Golden Yellow, Linden Green, Permanent 
        Green Middle and Deep, Winsor Green, Sky Blue, Winsor Blue, Burnt Sienna, 
        Raw and Burnt Umber, Chinese Orange, and Spektrum Violet.<br>
        <img src="steps.jpg" width="750" height="153" vspace="10"><br>
        When 
        the blueboards and pencil sketches were finished, he juxtaposed alongside 
        them blocks of text affixed with Scotch tape meant to carry readers along 
        through a loose narrative. He punched his ideas out on an old portable 
        typewriter, usually by way of the hunt-and-peck method, and many of these 
        paper scraps contained typos, spelling and syntax errors - even poor grammar. 
        But an editor could fix that up. Being smarty-smart all the time wasn't 
        necessary for a guy who hated school. Richard Scarry was a slapstick make-'em-laugh 
        funny man first, an "educator" second. His singular purpose: 
        entertain the kids. Be funny without being stupid. Don't do it in a way 
        they've seen a million times before. And whatever the cost, don't be boring.<img src="big.jpg" width="750" height="446" vspace="10"></p>
      <p>He hated white space, deliberately filling up each page with as much 
        pictorial matter as possible. By doing so, young readers would want to 
        scan the books over and over, possibly finding something new with each 
        <img src="dog.jpg" width="137" height="272" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">reading. 
        Exploded views and simplified cut-away diagrams became commonplace throughout 
        his work. Editors noticed that Scarry's "children's books" were 
        becoming more complicated - his illustrations had grown so dense that 
        even a single page required endless hours of fact-checking and research. 
        Scarry's personal library (and by proxy, that of his editors) contained 
        encyclopedias, travel books, cardboard boxes filled with pictures torn 
        from old magazines, restaurant menus, vacation snapshots from every corner 
        of the globe during his military travels, and rubber-banded rolls of architectural 
        diagrams. He would outdo himself time <img src="druggist.jpg" width="275" height="188" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">and 
        time again, from <i>What Do People Do All Day</i> to <i>Richard Scarry's 
        Great Big Schoolhouse</i>. At this stage of the game, his advances were 
        upwards of $105,000.</p>
      <p>One day some of these sketches were sitting on Scarry's editor's desk, 
        and Theodore Geisel (aka <b>Dr. Seuss</b>) unexpectedly strolled into 
        the office. Dr. Seuss wandered over to the table and began idly leafing 
        through Scarry's preliminary drawings. He didn't ask whose work it was. 
        Seuss and Scarry were two very different men. Seuss worked primarily with 
        words, Scarry with pictures. Suddenly Seuss stopped flipping and asked, 
        <b>"Does this sort of thing sell?" </b>It sold very well indeed. 
        In fact, Richard Scarry's books had been outselling Seuss's for years. 
        But neither author would ever really know that, due to the "good 
        diplomacy" management style strictly upheld at Random House.</p>
      <p><img src="fire.jpg" width="750" height="303">Richard also 
        admired the work of Beatrix Potter, but he made every effort not to copy 
        her style. Yes, they both put articles of clothing on anthropomorphic 
        animals, but she spent countless hours studying them and making realistic 
        drawings. The reader never thinks of her characters as human. Scarry would 
        occasionally emphasize a particular animal habit (Bananas Gorilla likes 
        bananas and t<img src="touch.jpg" width="227" height="262" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">ries 
        to steal them, Lowly Worm pokes his way through apples, and there's always 
        a hole in the roof of a bus to accommodate a giraffe's long neck) - but 
        these characteristics are a source of incidental humor, not as a means 
        of establishing a figure's identity as an animal.</p>
      <p>The real reason he worked this way was that drawing animals was more 
        fun than drawing humans. Fun to draw, fun for kids, and fun for the adults 
        compelled by their children to read these books over <img src="banana.jpg" width="235" height="234" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">and 
        over. "If I show a human father falling off a ladder or getting into 
        a monstrous auto crash," he remarked, "it suggests danger and 
        getting hurt. If I show Father Pig in the same situation, nothing more 
        is hurt than his dignity. Also, a chocolate cake can explode out of Mother 
        Bear's oven."</p>
      <p>To Richard, pigs, cats, bears, hippos, giraffes, lions and so forth were 
        not animals. They were real people living normal lives, performing everyday 
        tasks like. He made every effort to completely subtract elements of delineated 
        racial characteristics, believing that even a simple illustration of a 
        girl with blonde hair could not be fully related to by a girl with dark 
        hair. But both girls might relate and respond to bunny rabbits.</p>
      <p><img src="ali.jpg" width="351" height="236" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">After 
        twenty years with Golden Books, Scarry moved across Madison Avenue to 
        Random House. While the publishing company was pleased as punch to receive 
        him, it was here that Richard Scarry started to receive his first batch 
        of hate mail. </p>
      <p><img src="hangers.jpg" width="201" height="276" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">Letters 
        of complaint poured in about the roles played by women in reformed-gigolo 
        Scarry's picture books. The increasing importance and acceptance of the 
        feminist movement in the United States called into question why a large 
        percentage of Scarry's female characters were depicted as housewives: 
        cooking, cleaning, washing dishes. Scarry, now a significantly older man, 
        was a bit incensed. He maintained that because his characters were <i>animals</i>, 
        and because most wore <i>trousers</i>, it was difficult to discern whether 
        or not a worker was a man or a woman. Besides, most of the women characters 
        dressed just like men anyway, a trait arguably mirrored by the feminists 
        themselves. Random House urged him to change with the times, and he wasn't 
        too difficult to persuade once he learned sales were being affected. His 
        <i>Best Word Book Ever</i> was still his number-one bestseller, and it 
        was accused of being the worst offender. And so he drew new art, using 
        women workers on the job, and depicting men taking a more active interest 
        in household duties.</p>

        more scandal. Racial issues began to surface when Random House re-released 
        <i>Busy, Busy World.</i> This picture book had been a pinnacle of achievement 
        for Scarry when he was at Golden Books. It was a labor of love, incorporating 
        his fondness for travel and appreciation for other cultures. But changing 
        times and buckets of hate mail at Random House suggested that characters 
        like Manuel of Mexico (with a pot of refried beans stuck on his head), 
        Ah-Choo the near-sighted panda bear from Hong Kong, and Angus the Scottish 
        bagpiper were no longer acceptable role models for children. Random House 
        quietly subtracted some of Scarry's best stories from future distribution, 
        including the much-loved vignette of Patrick Pig, who shouts "UP 
        THE IRISH" after kissing the Blarney stone. That story can be found 
        in earlier copies of Golden Book's <i>Busy Busy World</i>, in the remainder 
        bin of your local thrift store.</p>

        never received a single award. None of his drawings were ever selected 
        by the <i>New York Times</i> as among the best of the year, and he never 
        won a Caldecott Honor. It was widely considered among awards committees 
        that not only was he <i>too</i> popular, he sold <b>too</b> many books. 
        The millions of dollars he earned were considered his "reward" 
        - his great success disqualifying him from being eligible.</p>
      <p>In the 1980's, Richard's eyesight was complicated by macular degeneration, 
        a progressive disorder which attacks the central part of the retina, causing 
        gradual loss of vision. His last book, <i>Richard Scarry's Biggest Word 
        Book Ever</i> was one of his largest accomplishments, weighing in at 15 
        3/4 x 24 inches. Although Random House was forced to charge $29.00 per 
        copy, the entire printing run quickly sold out.</p>
      <p>Richard later developed <a href="/library/death/maladies/cancer/throat/">cancer of the esophagus</a>. An operation to remove 
        the tumor, along with follow-up chemotherapy and evacuation of excess 
        fluid from his lungs was not enough to prevent a fatal heart attack. He 
        died in his home on April 30, 1994, at age 74. His wife Patsy died in 
        1995. Their son Huck carries on the tradition, writing and illustrating 
        fanciful, educational books for children.</p>
