The U.S. government wants to remove the policy of open information in favor
of a "born secret" standard, where any information that the public wants must
be pried out through legal means. Even if the information wanted has 
<i>nothing</i> to do with terrorism: "Ashcroft reverses this presumption,
instead calling on agencies to withhold information whenever the law
permits: <i>You can be assured that the Department of Justice will defend your
decisions.</i>" This new atmosphere is reminiscent of East Germany, frankly.

often you potty, etc. Big Corporate is Watching You.

Excellent article exploring the possibility that the White supremacists and
other domestic extremists within the United States may have strong ties to Iraq
and other Muslim terrorist organizations. One focus of the article is on Tim
McVeigh and Terry Nichols, who supposedly worked alone in planning the Oklahoma
City bombing. "Ramzi Yousef was in the Philippines at the same time as Nichols
and visited the same city out of which the Oklahoma City bombing was planned. I
doubt that connection ever was pursued." Yousef is currently in prison for
the first WTC bombing in 1993.

Pinheads in Pakistan. "The small-headed ones became known as chuhas — "rat
children" — and generations of them have been abandoned here by parents to take
their place in the legend." But there is also a more sinister side: "In the
past 15 years or so, the practice of reshaping a child's skull — so evil that
many people choose to call it rumor — has been snuffed out, said Mian
Ubaidullah, a Pakistani historian who studies the chuhas."

Cockfighting is legal in Louisiana, New Mexico and Oklahoma, but other

there are some federal efforts to put a halt to interstate transport of

If heterosexual pornography is never censored, why is gay porn being censored?
One can argue that porno of any kind is inappropriate in a prison settings,
but so is assbuggery -- but that doesn't mean it isn't going to happen.
Prisoners who have a sexual outlet from pornography are less likely to turn
their cellmates into pillowbiters. Serial murderer Dennis Nilsen is suing
for the right to have his porn untampered, like other prisoners.

FBI wants to tap <i>everything</i>
</b></font>
<br>
<font size=-1>Interactive Week | Submitted by: Soylent</font>
<br>
Apparently not satisfied with current Carnivore tapping, the FBI intends
to require ISP's (by any means necessary) to concentrate traffic in key
locations so that <i>all traffic</i> may be easily tapped. This 
is incredibly bad from a network design standpoint, creating centralized
bottlenecks that are then vulnerable to attack or error. And of course, 
this is like requiring all people to talk to any other people not directly,
but through approved third parties, in case the government is interested
in what you are saying.

Saudi Arabia is our reluctant ally in the mideast, primarily because
of fallout from the Persian Gulf war. And a prominent member of their
royal family, Interior Minister Prince Nayef, had this to say about
the Saudi's willingness to continue siding with the United States:
"He [Prince Nayef] also warned that the kingdom will side with any Arab
country that may become a target in the U.S.-led anti-terror campaign."

Transsexual in Castration Death

A woman, formerly a man, turned her husband, a man, into a woman. 
But complications from the unlicensed surgery resulted in her husband's 
death. That in itself would be unusual enough, but there are juicy
details -- "The home at 318 Smith Road lacked heat and water and was filled
with human and animal waste" and "McDonald found numerous dead animals,
including turtles, a parakeet and a cat that had been strung up in a tree
in the back yard." This is one of the stories that keeps on giving.

<b>Koryagina:</b> Some fluctuation in this date is possible. Serious forces are acting against <i>those who are now preparing the attack on the United States</i>. August, with very high probability, will bring the financial catastrophe to the U.S. . . .The last 10 days of August have especial importance from a religious-sensible point of view.

A microbiologist member of the Aryan Nations, Larry Wayne Harris, flirted
with biological toxins in the 1990's, until he was arrested by the FBI -- and
they found bubonic plague cultures in his Subaru. When asked how difficult
it was to obtain anthrax, Harris's answer: "I recovered anthrax, it took just
10 days. I checked the newspapers and found the last outbreak in Ohio, it was
in the 1950s. I found where the cows were buried and used a long prod to get a
sample. It's very deadly stuff". Harris's book also relates an encounter with
an Iraqi biotechnologist who told him they were plotting biowar against
the US in several years. Meaning..... right about now.

Microsoft has decided that a good amount of the blame for the recent worm
attacks on the Internet lies not with their egregiously faulty and insecure
software but instead with "open disclosure", the doctrine that security holes
ought to be published a short time after their discovery. Of course, what
Microsoft does not mention, is they often do not fix known security bugs 
<i>until</i> they are reported out in the open. Before open disclosure was
commonplace, many companies just never bothered fixing this type of bug at all.

The long term prospects in Saudi Arabia are grim. Their oil fields, containing
the largest reserves in the world, are highly vulnerable to terrorist attack.
The Saud Family is not well loved by their people, and has been appeasing
powerful fundamentalist forces in their country by funneling money to 
terrorist organizations including Hamas and possibly al-Qaida. Education in
the country has been taken over by fundamentalist Islam, and are producing
waves of PhD's in... Islamic Studies. And finally the United States has
minimized intelligence operations within the country so as not to upset
relations with the royal family. This is not a very smart strategy when
Saudi Arabia is the wealthiest, most important Arab nation in the world.

<br>
<font size=-1>E! | Submitted by: xase</font>
<br>
Just when you thought you couldn't have a sitcom based in a German
prisoner-of-war camp, CBS is considering a comedy based on the aftermath
of the WTC collapse. The series revolves around a couple who hook up
after their spouses are atomized in the terrorist attacks. No decision
has been made, yet.

A great article on Bin Laden's background and motives.
"Osama bin Laden's icy violence has a certain genealogical validation:
his father, having built the mosque at Mecca where the Kaabah is located,
and the mosque at Medina, is doubly blessed. Osama sold himself to the
conservative Saudi royalty by doing restoration work on the Dome of the
Rock at half the cost price (and still, inexplicably, like Milo
Minderbinder in Catch-22, made a killing)."

A second groovy 1970's photo of Osama bin Laden as a teenager has surfaced,

regarding Osama's background that is revealed in this story is that
<i>his mother was a concubine</i>, a fact that troubled the young lad greatly.

An NBC staffer opened a letter to TV anchorman Tom Brokaw, and caught

airborne anthrax that has hit the National Enquirer, and much more easily
treated by antibiotics. Since now anthrax has become a threat to the

We had heard stories of the hijackers drinking and cavorting the day before

"After spending Sunday night, Sept. 9, at the posh Charles Hotel in Cambridge,
two of the hijackers were en route by taxi on Monday to join two others at the
Milner Hotel when they asked the driver for names of local escort services,

"He's met them twice."

New York to give WTC Dirt to Families
</b></font>
<br>
<font size=-1>New York Daily News | Submitted by: Clay</font>
<br>
New York City will give families of WTC victims an urn containing soil
from the ground zero site. This is primarily in response to arrests made of
vendors selling WTC soil, which is perhaps no worse than TV networks
profiting from victims' misery.

The Isreali government is giving its blessing to the laying of the
cornerstone to the Third Temple, replacing edifices built by King Solomon
and last destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD. There is of course one minor
problem, one of the holiest sites of the Islamic religion, the Dome of
the Rock,  just happens to be on that site.

Hijacker Mohammed Atta sure was a charmer. Among the 18 instructions
specified in his Last Will And Testament: "Women must not be present at my
funeral or go to my grave at any later date." And also "He who washes my
body around my genitals should wear gloves so that I am not touched there."

<br>
Zacarias Moussaoui was arrested by the FBI on August 17, his computer
and hard drive seized. It contained some <i>very</i> interesting information,
but permission was not given to search the disk until after September 11.
Wind patterns, crop dusting, the works. Moussaoui attracted suspicion when
he wanted to learn to fly but didn't care about taking off or landing.

Between 1954 and 1970, the bones of 3400 children in the UK were used
for nuclear weapons testing without parental consent. The bones were
destroyed to test for Strontium 90 residues. This whole thing is reminiscent
of VD testing performed on American blacks last century.

One of the best articles on the CIA/FBI intelligence botch:
"C.I.A. surveillance apartments were closed and wiretaps turned off
throughout the Middle East and Europe. "We'll never know the losses we
had in terms of not capitalizing on the Soviet collapse," a retired
official said. Former high-level Soviet officials with intelligence
information or other data were rebuffed. "Walk-ins were turned away.
It was stunning, and, as far as I knew, nobody fought it."

"The art destroyed on September 11 had a total estimated value of $100

Japan outlawed teenage prostitution a mere two years ago. But vestiges
of this long and honored tradition linger to this day -- many Japanese men
eagerly try to sleep with very young girls. "If they can't get girls
under 18 years old, they find 19- or 20-year-olds and dress them up and
make them look like schoolgirls."
