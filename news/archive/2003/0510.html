A 63-year-old drunk driver with two previous DUI arrests crashed his truck through the front doors of a Northern California preschool, pinning an employee against a wall. She died on the spot, in front of an indeterminate number of toddlers. "Witnesses saw a speeding truck near Churn Creek Road and Le Brun Court, moments before it crashed through the doors of the building that serves as a preschool." According to a witness: "He went straight across the road. He perfectly made it right through the front doors." Some people are just perfectionists in everything they do.

"A South Florida man who ran down and killed a neighbor over a Halloween prank pleaded for mercy before learning his sentence Friday. In tears, Richard Day, 59, begged the judge not to sentence him to life. 'I want to go home to my wife and son,' he said. 'This is no way to retire, you know?'" After his house was egged on Halloween two years ago, Day hopped in his truck and ran down 39-year-old Richard Campbell, "dragging him nearly 200 feet to his death." Although he claims the killing was unintentional, "after the incident Day was heard laughing and saying that Campbell got what he deserved."

"The brains of [roughly 50,000] mentally ill and depressed people were illegally removed for research, a government inquiry is expected to reveal. The report, to be published on Monday, is thought to say that between 1970 and 1999 brains were often given to researchers following a patient's death, without the consent of the families." Perhaps the United Kingdom has spent the last 30 years building an army of Frankensteins.

Two guys walk into a Cincinnati bar waving handguns, and one of them shouts: "This is a robbery. Nobody move." Then a bar patron whips out his gun and shoots one of the robbers in the head. Police wind up charging the vigilante with two counts: felonious assault and carrying a weapon inside a tavern. The two hoodlums are held solely for aggravated robbery. Apparently you only get charged with "carrying a weapon inside a tavern" if you weren't actually planning on pointing your gun at anybody in the bar.

After barricading himself in his house, a 62-year-old cabdriver left police no option but to shoot him. In Britain's first-ever case of "suicide by cop," Michael Malsbury decided to live out a fantasy evidently built around Westerns. "He had a 'cowboy attitude' and referred to 'high noon' during police negotiations. Finally Malsbury stepped out of his room shouting 'Better get your guns out lads, I’m coming out' -- and was shot in the chest. He had pointed the gun at officers and fired a shot in their direction." Yet more proof that guns don't kill people; "Gunsmoke" does.

In 1983, A.A. Milne's son Christopher Robin signed away his Winnie the Pooh royalties to the Walt Disney Company and to the estate of his father's book agent. Disney would like to quit having to cough up $10 million a year to the agent's family for their continued use of the character. So they cut a deal with Clare Milne, who agreed to sell them the remaining rights if she could repo them from the current owners. Unfortunately for Disney and Clare, the judge has found that there is no legal basis for her suit. We bet there's one thing all parties can agree to: that Winnie the Pooh's copyright should be effectively immortal, just like Mickey Mouse's.
