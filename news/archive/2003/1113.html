"Teachers at the Roman Catholic-run Little Flower School outside Qumbu found a pornographic magazine on a pupil's desk on May 2002 during her absence. The pupil was called to the staff room the following day and confronted about the magazine. She was then forced to read some passages from the magazine. At some stage a banana was bought from a hawker and given to her. She was ordered to push it up her vagina. She was also beaten up with a switch... The magistrate also said the pupil displayed herself as a sexual activist by bringing such books to school and that the pupil was accused of 'sleeping' with her uncle and a taximan. The pupil had no dignity to protect, said Qwaqwa, because she had brought the pornographic magazine to school, probably to 'poison' other children."

"John Gray's bizarre claims about his education make him look more like a Martian than a reputable 'doctor.' <i>The New York Post</i> picked up the story first reported at <i>CultNews</i> about the relationship guru who faked his education. Gray calls himself a 'doctor,' but has no accredited college degree, even though he belongs to professional organizations that require them... Oprah and <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/radio/larry-king/">Larry King</a> were both taken in, not to mention Harper Collins Gray's publisher.

"The Brazilian woman with the most body piercings in the world - 1,903 - fears returning to her crime-ridden home country as she would attract so much attention she could be robbed. 'The last time I went to Brazil, I had to wear a face mask because since I have a lot of jewellery (pierced to the skin), I fear being robbed or attacked,' Elaine Davidson told Reuters from Edinburgh in Britain where she lives... Davidson, who has been outside her home country for 10 years, won an entry in this year's <i>Guinness World Records</i> book after starting to pierce herself four years ago... Her genitalia is the body part where she has the largest number of piercings - 500 in all, externally and internally."

The suit, filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, accuses Dr. Phil and his co-defendants of imprisoning her in a Marina Del Rey apartment, where she shattered her leg in the act of escaping out a window with bed sheets she had tied together. Her leg eventually had to be amputated below the knee...

"Four soldiers at Fort Benning have been arrested and accused of stabbing to death a member of their infantry unit, setting the body on fire and leaving it in the woods just days after their return from Iraq. Police said the soldiers had gotten mad at Spc. Richard R. Davis for insulting a dancer at a strip club and getting them kicked out of the place... 'They were upset with Mr. Davis for getting them thrown out of the club,' Columbus Detective Andrew Tyner testified at a hearing Monday. Tynder said the soldiers began arguing after leaving the strip club, and a fistfight broke out in the woods. After Davis was killed, the soldiers drove to a convenience store and bought lighter fluid, and at least two of the men set the body on fire, police said."

"The world's oldest person has died in Japan at the age of 114. Mitoyo Kawate died of pneumonia at a hospital in the southwestern city of Hiroshima, Japanese officials said. She was recognised by the Guinness World Records as the oldest person on 31 October, shortly after the death of fellow Japanese Kamato Hongo, aged 116... Mitoyo Kawate was born on 15 May 1889 - less than a month after <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/nazi/adolf-hitler/">Adolf Hitler</a> and in the same year as the Eiffel Tower was completed in Paris."

"The US Supreme Court has let stand a ruling by a federal appeals court in February that officials in the state of Arkansas had the right to force a convicted murderer to take drug treatment to make him sane enough to be <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/execution/">executed</a>. In 1986 the Supreme Court proclaimed it illegal to execute people unless they understood that they were being put to death and why. An appeals court based in St Louis ruled in February this year that the constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment would not be violated if the authorities forcibly gave antipsychotic medication to the inmate, Charles Laverne Singleton."

"One human chimera came to light when a 52-year-old woman demanded an explanation from doctors after tests showed that two of her three grown-up sons were biologically unrelated to her. Although the woman, 'Jane,' conceived them naturally with her husband, tests to see if she could donate a kidney suggested that somehow she had given birth to somebody else's children... Jane is a chimera, a mixture of two individuals - non-identical twin sisters - whose cells intermingled in the womb and grew into a single body... For some reason, cells from only one twin dominate in Jane's blood - used for tissue-typing. In her other tissues, however, including her ovaries, cells of both twins live amicably alongside each other, hence the apparently impossible genetics of her three sons."

"Benjamin Schragger was known as Lord Ben the Steward at <i>The Farm</i>, a peaceful retreat where children gathered for sleepovers and re-enacted medieval history under Schragger's supervision. That serenity was shattered when Schragger, 42, was charged with abusing children, allegations that are fragmenting parents and alumni from the Society for Creative Anachronism into camps of support and outrage. Prosecutors say Schragger abused 10 children, ages 7 to 14, from June 1999 to August this year. He faces charges ranging from indecent assault to rape."

"A private Greek television station has been fined $116,000 for broadcasting a scene of two men kissing, reports said Wednesday... Mega television was fined by the independent licensing body, the National Radio and Television Council, for the Oct. 6 scene showing two male actors kissing in the weekly drama <i>Close Your Eyes</i>. The council - usually tolerant of the frequent nudity and sexual content of Greek television - described the scene as 'vulgar and unacceptable.'"

"Custodians in William L. Harkness Hall opened the building on Oct. 28 to find nude pictures taped to the walls, Yale Police Department Lt. Michael Patten said. In the background of the pornography, custodians saw something very familiar: the rooms of WLH... 'After I drank out of the water fountain - we found pictures where this guy put his stuff in the drinking fountain,' [Greg Simpson, a custodian] said. The men in the pictures also placed their penises on some of the building's doorknobs and telephones and used them to press the buttons on the elevator. 'You know, I touched those buttons without putting my gloves on,' Simpson said. 'I drink out of that water fountain.'"

"Radio talk show host Jon Matthews, who has been a fixture of the Houston broadcast scene for more than a decade, was indicted by a Fort Bend County grand jury on a charge of indecency with a child. The indictment, which was unsealed Wednesday after Matthews was arrested, alleges Matthews knowingly and intentionally exposed his genitals to a girl under the age of 17 on Oct. 9... The conservative talk show host, who also writes a column for a Fort Bend weekly newspaper, was taken into custody by Sugar Land police about 3 p.m. and driven to police headquarters... The outspoken Matthews, who has been a constant critic of liberals, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/">Bill Clinton</a> and Houston Mayor Lee Brown's administration, resigned from his position at KSEV-AM 700."
