somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"The Pentagon is setting up a stock-market style system in which investors would bet on terror attacks, assassinations and other events in the Middle East. Defense officials hope to gain intelligence and useful predictions while investors who guessed right would win profits. ... The market would work this way. Investors would buy and sell futures contracts -- essentially a series of predictions about what they believe might happen in the Mideast. Holder of a futures contract that came true would collect the proceeds of investors who put money into the market but predicted wrong. A graphic on the market's Web page showed hypothetical futures contracts in which investors could trade on the likelihood that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would be assassinated or Jordanian King Abdullah II would be overthrown. Although the Web site described the Policy Analysis Market as 'a market in the future of the Middle East,' the graphic also included the possibility of a North Korea missile attack. ... 'Can you imagine if another country set up a betting parlor so that people could go in ... and bet on the assassination of an American political figure, or the overthrow of this institution or that institution?'"

"The remarks by <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/condoleeza-rice/">Rice</a> and her associates raise two uncomfortable possibilities for the national security adviser. Either she missed or overlooked numerous warnings from intelligence agencies seeking to put caveats on claims about Iraq's <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/atomic-bomb/">nuclear weapons</a> program, or she made public claims that she knew to be false. ... 'If the national security adviser didn't understand the repeated State Department and CIA warnings about the uranium allegation, that's a frightening level of incompetence,' said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (Calif.), who as the ranking Democrat on the Government Reform Committee has led the charge on the intelligence issue. 'It's even more serious if she knew and ignored the intelligence warnings and has deliberately misled our nation. . . . In any case it's hard to see why the president or the public will have confidence in her office.'"

On Wednesday night, he said, his troops picked up the wife and daughter of an Iraqi lieutenant general. They left a note: 'If you want your family released, turn yourself in.' Such tactics are justified, he said, because, 'It's an intelligence operation with detainees, and these people have info.' They would have been released in due course, he added later. The tactic worked. On Friday, Hogg said, the lieutenant general appeared at the front gate of the U.S. base and surrendered."

"John G. Koeltl, a federal judge in New York, was struggling to understand the theory under which the government was prosecuting a lawyer for supporting terrorism. Where, he asked at a hearing in June, is the line between constitutionally protected political activity and criminal conduct? 'You know it when you see it, your honor,' the prosecutor, Christopher J. Morvillo, replied. That struck Judge Koeltl as dangerously inadequate. Last week, he threw out two terrorism counts against the lawyer, Lynne Stewart... In the process, he dealt a serious blow to the government's favorite legal tool in the fight against terrorism. Virtually every criminal case concerning terrorism filed since the Sept. 11 attacks has relied on the 1996 law prohibiting 'material support' of terrorist organizations that Judge Koeltl rejected."

"Amid the scramble to baton down strange-looking, obviously expensive equipment, a local resident eased up in his four-wheel-drive truck and with hesitant smile, asked what these strangers were up to. ... 'this episode is about <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/cryptozoology/bigfoot/">Bigfoot</a>. ... We're taking a very scientific, technological approach and using an amazing amount of technology that’s never been used before. This is a very academic study,' she said, pointing to the groups numerous thermal imaging cameras (one held aloft by a 13-foot helium balloon that floats over an extended area), call blasting techniques of animals in distress, and use of DNA-based traps such as pheromone chips made from bacteria found in the vaginal tracts of humans and gorillas."

"In a bizarre incident, six members of a family, including two children, allegedly committed suicide in the forest on the way to Tirumala Hills. The bodies were found hanging from a tree in a highly decomposed condition and the police are trying to identify them. A couple in the age group of 40 to 45, another in the age group of 33 to 36, a seven-year-old girl and another girl child comprise the family which might have committed suicide on Friday. ... The couples seem to have hung the children first with a saree from a tree branch before repeating the act themselves. Two pesticide tins were also found in a handbag, found near the bodies."

"Chevy Chase is starring in a TV advertising campaign for a new Turkish cola that competes with Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola at a time of heightened anti-American feeling in Turkey. ... Mr. Chase is seen parking his Griswold-style station wagon at his suburban home, where his wife is preparing a Turkish meal for her parents and the children. At the dinner table everyone sings 'Take Me Out to the Ball Game' until they take a sip of Cola Turka and break into a Turkish-language 1930s Boy Scout song that is part of Turkey's national identity. At the end of the spot, Mr. Chase sprouts a bushy mustache."

"'There are a lot of orifices in the human body, and there are a lot of accidents that happen,' Schotz says. 'We've spent years compiling this show. ... Sometimes you'd just come across a picture that would just stop you, and you'd go, "<i>That's so wrong.</i>"' The special blends shudder-inducing footage and still photos of accident scenes, X-rays, objects in formaldehyde jars, etc., with interviews with victims and the doctors and emergency medical techs who saved their lives. In addition to the freak accidents, the special explores a whole subcategory of self-mutilation, ranging from the jewel thief who hides a diamond necklace too well to an array of kinky experiments gone awry. 'It's one thing when a 2-by-4 gets picked up in a hurricane and it hits you in the head,' Schotz says. 'When you start getting into handlebars and Ivory soap, it gets more complicated.'"
