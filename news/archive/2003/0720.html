somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

By 'they,' Madina was referring to Amin's entourage in Saudi Arabia, where Idi Amin, a Muslim now in his eighties, has lived in obscurity for more than 10 years."

"A top NYPD official who allegedly looted $113,000 from a jailhouse charity to help pay for thousands of inmates' calls to X-rated chat lines, frequently eavesdropped on the steamy sessions, sources told <i>The Post</i>. ... When they searched Patrick's Harlem apartment, investigators found 'not a stick of furniture, just a bed' -- but they did discover stacks of pornographic tapes... He was charged with spending $112,733.99 in foundation funds to pay for collect calls to his home from inmates he had met while working as a Correction Department deputy commissioner. Investigators say he made 'thousands and thousands' of calls to '900' sex lines from his home, patching inmates' calls into the porn lines and apparently listening in."

"David L. Beale, who once worked at a pathology firm, was taken into custody for investigation of removing human remains with the intent to sell or dissect, possession of methamphetamine and possession of stolen property, authorities said. ... On Friday, authorities found about 157 pounds of human remains, including heads, organ tissue, a dissected torso and spinal cords that were chemically prepared and stored in plastic and glass containers. The remains were being stored near his house. ... 'While all of this new information has not answered the question of who left the original remains beside the Dumpster at Slatter's Court on June 3, it certainly tends to discount the homicide/serial killer/satanic cult theories associated with this case,' said Lt. Jim Harritt of Davis Police."

"The strikes, which were conducted from mid-2002 into the first few months of 2003, were justified publicly at the time as a reaction to Iraqi violations of a no-flight zone that the United States and Britain established in southern Iraq. But Lt. Gen. T. Michael Moseley, the chief allied war commander, said the attacks also laid the foundations for the military campaign against the Baghdad government. ... During that period before the war, American officials said the strikes were necessary because the Iraqis were shooting more often at allied air patrols. ... But General Moseley said it was possible that the Iraqi attacks increased because allied planes had stepped up their patrols over Iraq. '<i>We became a little more aggressive based on them shooting more at us, which allowed us to respond more,</i>' he said. '<i>Then the question is whether they were shooting at us because we were up there more. So there is a chicken and egg thing here.</i>'"

"The story of the 'boy who ran away from chemotherapy' was told across the U.S., and, after Billy saw his tearful mother on a national news show, he agreed to come home when she vowed there would be no more chemo. Instead, the family, born-again Christians, 'prayed and asked God to lead us to the right treatment for Billy,' says his mother, Sue. They found his medical salvation in 714X, a controversial Canadian-made 'nitrogenated' and camphor-based compound that Billy began injecting into the lymph nodes in his groin every day for 21 days, followed by a few days off. Before the needles started, he says, Boston oncologists told him his cancer was getting worse. Within three months of starting 714X as part of an alternative regimen that also included Essiac tea, CAT scans and other imaging tests showed the cancer was gone."
