"The discovery of a piece of cooked penis in her stew was so traumatic for a hospital cleaner that she had to receive psychiatric help. She was completely turned off meat, becoming a vegetarian overnight. ... It was slippery and she could not cut it with a knife. She took it in her hand and placed it in her mouth, but the court heard that the 'meat' was so tough she could not bite through it. She took the offending morsel out of her mouth, inspected it with her colleagues, and they all concluded that it was a penis. ... Because it had been cooked, it could not be established whether the penis was from a human or an animal."

"Police in Florida are creating a counterterrorism database designed to give law enforcement agencies around the country a powerful new tool to analyze billions of records about both criminals and ordinary Americans. Organizers said the system, dubbed Matrix, enables investigators to find patterns and links among people and events faster than ever before, combining police records with commercially available collections of personal information about most American adults. It would let authorities, for instance, instantly find the name and address of every brown-haired owner of a red Ford pickup truck in a 20-mile radius of a suspicious event. ... At least 135 police agencies in the state have signed up for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement database service, which began operation more than a year ago. At least a dozen states -- including Pennsylvania, New York and Michigan -- said they want to add their records." [<i>Who needs TIA when you can just roll your own?</i>]

The <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration's dismissiveness toward scientists could also have serious consequences, from delaying vital new medical therapies to eroding America's general lead in science.

"Members of the independent panel examining the death of David 'Rocky' Bennett at the Norvic Clinic, near Norwich, in October 1998, have concluded after months of evidence that mental health services are 'institutionally racist.' ... 'Black people are 40 per cent more likely to be turned away when they ask the NHS for help. We are dealing with an institution which has historically let down black people, which is racist to the core.' Inquiry chairman, Sir John Blofeld, said: 'Our research has shown black mental health patients are over-medicated and spend too much time in secure wards.' ... On the final day's evidence, Sadiq Khan, the lawyer for Dr Joanna Bennett, Mr Bennett's sister, told the inquiry: 'We believe there is a hierarchy among NHS patients, with young black men at the bottom. There is a stark difference in the treatment of a young black man and a middle-aged white man, with the same symptoms or condition.'"
