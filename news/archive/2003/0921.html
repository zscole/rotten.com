Adil Salman Mousa told Reuters a group of U.S. soldiers were having a party in the zoo on Thursday night after it had closed. 'Someone was trying to feed the tigers,' he said. 'The tiger bit his finger off and clawed his arm. So his colleague took a gun and shot the tiger.' The night watchman said the soldiers had arrived in military vehicles but were casually dressed and were drinking beer."

"Three-year-old Chazarus Hill's reward for correctly recognizing the number on the flashcards his father showed him was to not get hit, Oakland police said. His punishment for wrong answers: a fist, a belt and whittled sticks. That combination proved deadly Saturday, shaken homicide investigators said. Veteran pathologists at the Alameda County Coroner's Office agreed the little boy died from the worst case of child abuse they had ever seen, police said, with one pathologist saying the injuries, which left the child bruised from head to toe, 'were like a boxer taking blows.'"

"White House officials have undermined their own government scientists' research into climate change to play down the impact of global warming... They have enlisted the help of conservative lobby groups funded by the oil industry to attack <i>US government scientists</i> if they produce work seen as accepting too readily that pollution is an issue. ... Former EPA climate policy adviser Jeremy Symons said morale at the agency had been devastated by the administration's tactics. He painted a picture of scientists afraid to conduct research for fear of angering their White House paymasters. 'They do good research,' he said. 'But they feel that they have a boss who does not want them to do it. And if they do it right, then they will get hit or their work will be buried.' Symons left the EPA in April 2001 and now works for the National Wildlife Federation as head of its climate change programme. The <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration's attitude was clear from the beginning, he said, and a lot of people were working to ensure that the President did nothing to address global warming."

"It kills pine seedlings, is a hot-burning fire hazard, squeezes out native plants and ruins habitats for threatened species such as the gopher tortoise and indigo snake. Cogon is even more aggressive and harder to get rid of than the ubiquitous kudzu. 'There's no pest, disease or fungus that destroys it,' said Ross Price, manager here of a 45,000-acre pine plantation for La Floresta Perdida Inc. ... 'Kudzu's a weenie plant compared to cogon grass,' said James H. Miller, research ecologist for the U.S. Forest Service in Auburn, Ala. Cogon is considered one of the world's 10 worst weeds and has invaded every continent except Antarctica. In the United States it has spread as far south as the Everglades, up into South Carolina and west into Texas, but Florida is the epicenter."

"Lynn and David were delighted when they found out Lynn was expecting their first child. But their joy didn't last long. 'Within two or three minutes, the radiographer who was doing the scan said, <i>"Ah, there's a bit of a problem, there's something wrong with your baby's bowel,"'</i> said Lynn. The baby had exomphalos -- a condition where the abdominal organs grow outside the body. The couple was offered three choices -- to do nothing, to have another test to see if there were further problems, or to <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/abortion/">terminate</a>. ... As Lynn remembers: 'It was like "Termination" -- big capital letters. <i>"It's not worth it, just get rid of it now dear. And then you can try a bit later on for another baby."'"</i>

"In 1946, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/business/walt-disney/">Walt Disney</a> and Salvador Dalí, in one of cinema's oddest collaborations, teamed up on a short film called <i>Destino</i>. But Disney's studio ran into financial trouble and put the unfinished film on the shelf. Now, 57 years later, a team of Disney animators has finished what Dalí started. ... Dalí, whose previous film experience included two short films with the Spanish master Luis Buñuel, approached Disney at a dinner party at the house of Warner Brothers head Jack Warner. Dalí, then working on Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Spellbound</i>, believed he and Disney could create what he called 'the first motion picture of the Never Seen Before.'"

"A Canadian gay couple has been refused entry into the United States after filling out joint customs forms as a family. The two men -- Joe Varnell and Kevin Bourassa who are legally married under Ontario law -- refused to fill out separate forms and cancelled their trip, to a human rights conference in Georgia. The US Embassy in Ottawa defended the action by US immigration officials at Toronto airport, saying that the 1996 US Defence of Marriage Act defined marriage as 'only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.'"

"The pop princess has been re-named Pissy Spears by so-called friends and shocked waiters, who watched her drop her drawers and wee on a beach a few days ago. ... Britney and her pal Clarissa Jones summoned Clarissa's fella Joshua Clephas and Joshua's pal Tom Witchey to Santa Barbara's Four Seasons Hotel for some fun. ... Britney and the gang went for a smoke on the beach below. 'It was unbelievable. The four of them were huddled at the water's edge, then Britney dropped her jeans and had a <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/bodily-functions/pissing/">wee</a> on the sand. Her friend also went and they didn't seem embarrassed doing it front of the boys -- or waiters!'"
