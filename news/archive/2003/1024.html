"Reverend Stephen White, infamous for preaching against homosexuality and sexual promiscuity at Yale and other college campuses, now faces charges that he solicited sex from a teenage boy in a Philadelphia suburb... White was arrested in June after he allegedly offered $20 to a 14-year-old boy in West Chester, Pa. for permission to perform oral sex on him. According to the boy's sworn affidavit, White approached him in a green Ford van and asked if he knew of any strip clubs, adult book stores or shops that sold sexually explicit videos. When then the boy said he did not, White unsuccessfully attempted to lure the boy into the vehicle. White then told the boy he could 'make some money' by letting White perform fellatio on him."

The skipper of the trawler <i>Erik the Red</i> ran into the shallow water and grabbed the shark by its tail with his bare hands. He dragged it off to dry land and killed it with his knife... Icelandic author and journalist Reynir Traustason, who knows the trawler captain, said the act was typical of the man. 'He's called "the Iceman" because he isn't scared of anything,' he said.

"Police say a man in his 20s went on a rampage along Plymouth Road on Detroit's west side, attacking several women with a pipe. There was no obvious motive for the attacks as the man apparently did not attempt to sexually assault or rob his victims, Local 4 reported. Police say at least five girls or women were attacked before some local residents decided to take action in what they referred to as Detroit-style street justice... a gray-color Grand Prix pulled up, and the persons inside the car fired five shots at the alleged attacker. Powell said the man then ran into an alley, where he was chased down and run over by the Grand Prix. The people inside the car then shot the man and left him behind, lying on the ground."

"In a move some called gutsy and others childish, San Francisco Supervisor Chris Daly used his powers as acting mayor Wednesday to appoint two people to the powerful Public Utilities Commission while Mayor Willie Brown was traveling in Tibet. It was a premeditated stroke of opportunism that observers said was without parallel in modern political times at City Hall and caught the Brown administration and Daly's Board of Supervisor colleagues by surprise. Unless Brown can muster eight votes on the 11-member board to overturn Daly's act, the appointments are likely to stand, city lawyers said, and would go down as audacious coup against one of the great political gamesmen in California history."

Masahiko Shizawa, a 43-year-old software entrepreneur from Yokohama, says Spears' guards confronted him on a public street at gunpoint and demanded that he leave the area... At an Oct. 7 hearing, a state judge ordered Shizawa not to contact the entertainer and to stay at least 300 yards from her for three years... Judge Alan Haber determined that Shizawa 'engaged in a pattern of harassment and stalking' Spears for more than a year."

"Naturalists celebrated the discovery of a new species of bird - a blue-flecked, seed-eating finch - in Venezuela, but they mourned that a state electricity company destroyed its only known habitat to make way for a dam... the species was first spotted on Carrizal Island, an uninhabited islet on the Caroni river in biodiverse southeastern Venezuela, in July 2001. It took two years for researchers to conclude the bird, of which three examples were found, was a new species. They called it the Carrizal Seedeater. In that time, the bird's habitat of thickets of spiny bamboo on the island were razed as part of the construction of a massive hydroelectric dam."

Eugene 'Gino' Dozzi, 44, was arrested at the couple's home last night and charged with inciting South Allegheny High School students to engage in a food fight in the school cafeteria in April and supplying cigarettes to some of the students. Terry Dozzi, who found out about the arrest during a school board meeting last night, rushed over to Burnett's office on Ninth Street to await her husband's arraignment. Burnett, who witnessed the incident, said Dozzi's car came up Allegheny Avenue and turned on to Ninth, struck [District Police Chief Kristopher I.

Kircher said Eugene Dozzi told three students at his house to start a food fight in the school cafeteria and to 'resist and assault police officers if any attempts were made to detain them.'"
