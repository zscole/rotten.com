"The notorious San Francisco Zodiac Killer, who mysteriously dropped out of sight almost 30 years ago after a bloody reign of terror that left five dead, may have been 'hiding' in plain sight -- locked away in prison for two unrelated murders. A <i>Post</i> investigation unearthed 'compelling' links between 54-year-old killer William Mentzer -- who's serving life without the possibility of parole -- and the police profile of the Zodiac Killer, the San Francisco District Attorney's Office says. The dramatic new information has been turned over to the San Francisco Police Department, which for 35 years has searched for the fiendish killer. ... One week after the initial interviews, <i>The Post</i> confronted Mentzer with the information linking him to the Zodiac Killer. <i>'I am not the Zodiac,'</i> he fumed. <i>'I am not some crazed killer, but I think I know who he is.'</i> Mentzer said he met the Zodiac while they were incarcerated at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi in the early '90s. He described the Zodiac as a 240-pound black man. Police say the Zodiac is white."

"Citing a provision of the Patriot Act, the FBI is sending letters to journalists telling them to secretly prepare to turn over their notes, e-mails and sources to the bureau. ... The Bureau recently sent letters to a handful of reporters who have written stories about the Lamo case -- whether or not they have actually interviewed Lamo. The letters warn them to expect subpoenas for all documents relating to the hacker, including, apparently, their own notes, e-mails, impressions, interviews with third parties, independent investigations, privileged conversations and communications, off the record statements, and expense and travel reports related to stories about Lamo. In short, everything. ... the FBI has threatened to put these reporters in jail unless they agree to preserve all of these records while they obtain a subpoena for them under provisions amended by the USA-PATRIOT Act. The FBI doesn't want the reporters talking to anyone, because that would supposedly harm the ongoing criminal investigation. The government also officiously informed the reporters that this is an 'official criminal investigation' and asks that they not disclose the request to preserve documents, or the contents of the letter, to anyone -- presumably including their editors, directors, or lawyers -- under the implied threat of prosecution for obstruction of justice."

"The St. Petersburg city council passed a law Monday designed to scuttle a rock group's plans to feature an onstage suicide. The hard-rock band Hell on Earth had said that a suicide by a terminally ill person would take place during a concert Saturday to raise awareness of right-to-die issues. In response, the city council met Monday morning to unanimously approve an emergency ordinance making it illegal to conduct a suicide for commercial or entertainment purposes, and to host, promote and sell tickets for such an event. ... Tampa-based Hell of Earth, known for such outrageous onstage stunts as chocolate syrup wrestling and grinding up live rats in a blender, created the furor by announcing the suicide would happen Saturday at the Palace Theater in downtown St. Petersburg."

"Coffin makers are waking up to the demands of an increasingly obese population. Anecdotal evidence suggests that across America, as people get bigger, so are their burial caskets. ... Keith and Julane Davis, who run the Goliath Casket company in Lynn, Indiana, said that when they set up business in the late 1980s they would sell just one triple-width coffin a year. Nowadays every month they ship four or five of these vast caskets -- 44in across, as opposed to a standard 24in, and capable of holding a body weighing up to 700lbs without 'losing its integrity.'"

Burning fragments were said to have fallen over a wide area, destroying several houses. ... Reports from Kendrapara district in Orissa, where the meteor came to Earth, said windows rattled as it passed overhead. ... The only recorded fatality from a meteor was an Egyptian dog that had the bad luck to be in the wrong place at the wrong time in 1911."

"Last month, Sonoma Saveurs was spray-painted and flooded by vandals because of a delicacy that will appear on its menu and in its store: foie gras, the fat-engorged liver of force-fed ducks and geese. Connoisseurs consider foie gras the epitome of culinary civilization. But animal rights activists who claimed responsibility for the destruction -- and for an earlier attack on the homes of the cafe's chef and his partner -- call foie gras the 'delicacy of despair,' born of cruelty to animals. ... The attacks began in Mill Valley in late July, when vandals went to the home of Mr. Manrique, 38, who is also the chef and a co-owner of Sonoma Saveurs, putting acid on his car, gluing the lock on a door, and spray-painting slogans like 'Stop or Be Stopped.' Most ominous, they left behind a videotape, taken through a window, showing Mr. Manrique and his family, including his 2-year-old son, playing in the house."

"Ted Turner told a newspaper group Sunday night he does not have an optimistic outlook for the future of the world. 'If I had to predict, the way things are going, I'd say the chances are about 50-50 that humanity will be extinct or nearly extinct within 50 years,' Turner said. '<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wmd/biological-weapons/">Weapons of mass destruction</a>, disease, I mean this global warming is scaring the living daylights out of me.' ... 'The most dangerous thing in the world right now is the fact the Russian and American <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/atomic-bomb/">nuclear missiles</a>, 10 years after the Cold War is over, are still a hair-trigger away with less than 10 minutes response time from two presidents who thankfully are together today,' Turner said."
