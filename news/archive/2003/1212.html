"A judge has ruled that a Pakistani man convicted of attacking his 17-year-old fiancee with acid be blinded with acid himself, police said Friday. Mohammed Sajid, 19, poured acid on the face of his fiancee Rabia Bibi on June 24 in Bahawalpur, a city in the eastern Pakistani province of Punjab... The woman lost both eyes and her face was burned in the attack, which police said followed a minor dispute between the couple... The judge ordered that a doctor perform the punishment publicly at a sports stadium."

But church documents obtained by the <i>Weekly</i> reveal that Fuentes for five years supervised a priest caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> with a 13-year-old boy in a Sacramento area graveyard... Father Jerome Henson was head pastor at St. John the Baptist Church in Costa Mesa until the Orange diocese placed him on inactive leave last year when church officials learned of a police report detailing his 1981 nighttime boneyard tryst... an officer found Henson with a 13-year-old boy 'wearing a tank-top and blue athletic-type shorts' leaning against a graveyard fence. '[The victim] had his back to the fence with his hands holding on to the top bar,' the report notes. '[The victim] was suspended in the air with both of his legs draped over Henson's shoulders.'"

In a series of photos, Michael and TJ, who was 17 at the time of the shoot, stand tightly together as TJ progressively loses more and more of his clothing - to the point where he's wearing just a pair of socks and undershorts, which he proceeds to pull down, exposing his pubic hair. 'There was a stylist there, but the shoot was basically directed by Michael,' a source tells <i>Star</i>. 'At one point, he began ripping up TJ's shirt while he was still wearing it. The vibe was weird, but no one would say anything to Michael, that's for sure.'"

"An 11-year-old Woodbridge boy told a family court judge yesterday that he struck 3-year-old Amir Beeks with a baseball bat and dumped him in a creek after the toddler followed him home from a neighborhood library last spring. Pleading guilty to murder and kidnapping, Aaron Kean, who was 10 at the time of the crime in March, said Amir was bothering him and wanted to use his scooter... Amir never regained consciousness after he was beaten in Aaron's backyard playhouse on March 26 and left in a drainage ditch alongside the older boy's home in the Colonia section of Woodbridge. Police found Amir face-down in the shallow water with his pants down. Based on physical evidence, authorities initially charged Aaron with sexually assaulting Amir with an unidentified object. The child died the next day at JFK Medical Center in Edison."

"President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> on Thursday defended his decision to exclude countries that did not support the U.S.-led effort to topple Iraqi President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a> from bidding on some $18.6 billion in reconstruction contracts... Asked whether the exclusion of those countries from bidding on construction contracts violates international law, Bush said, 'I don't know what you're talking about by "international law." I better consult my lawyer.'"

"When the city and its police union squared off in contract negotiations this year, their differences escalated into an edgy labor skirmish... following a City Council meeting, when police arrested Mayor Normand Guay on drunk driving charges. But Guay passed a breath test with flying colors, and a 75-page report by [former US attorney Jay McCloskey] and a longtime federal drug agent indicated that the mayor might have been targeted because of the labor impasse. According to the report, which has not been made public, off-duty officers at the police station applauded his arrest... a breath test showed Guay's blood-alcohol level to be 0.01 percent, far below Maine's 0.08 percent standard for intoxication. Prosecutors later dropped the charge and said the mayor, who is a state probation official and former Auburn police officer, was not drunk."

"An ad for 'Party City' was supposed to highlight a sale on Hanukkah items, but it also contained a hateful <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/racism/anti-semitism/">anti-Semitic</a> message. The advertisement includes the sentence '<b>CC HATES THE JEWS</b>' in large, bold letters. According to ADVO, the company that printed the advertisement, a graphic artist working on the ad had left his desk for a moment, and a co-worker with the initials C.C. changed the text on the ad... ADVO representatives in Dallas said they are mortified by the oversight and that they are trying to figure out why the error was never caught."
