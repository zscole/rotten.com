"Wells died last week after robbing a bank near Erie when a bomb hanging from a locked, metal collar around his neck exploded. Pleading with police to help him get the bomb off, Wells told authorities he had been forced to rob the bank, indicating that someone else had clasped the bomb to him. ... Former FBI agent Candice DeLong doesn't buy Wells' story that he was kidnapped while delivering pizza and collared with the bomb. 'I had to ask myself would bad guys who are sophisticated enough to devise or develop this collar bomb put it on someone that they had no idea would carry out their plan successfully?' ... 'I think it was less than 30 minutes to get back to them with whatever cash he might have been able to steal,' DeLong said. 'They had no idea what he was going to do. If somebody grabs me and puts a collar bomb around my neck I'm going to the nearest police station and say <i>"get this thing off me."'"</i>

Mr Thompson later noticed his son was pale and the baby's arms went limp before he stopped breathing, the court heard. ... An autopsy revealed that as well as a ruptured liver Jordan had four broken ribs, two of which had been fractured for up to a week.

"An Israeli scientist said on Wednesday his team had found a way to break into mobile phone calls made on the popular GSM network, allowing eavesdroppers to listen in on calls and even take on a caller's identity. ... 'We can listen in to a call while it is still at the ringing stage and within a fraction of a second know everything about the user,' Biham said. 'Then we can listen in to the call.' ... They have sent a copy of their research to the GSM Association to help them correct the problem, and the method is being patented and will be used only by law enforcement agencies, he said."

"The recipe for synthetic chicken starts with a vat of industrial gelatin, not too unlike the lime, cherry and lemon varieties sold in the grocery store. To that, the "chefs" at Southwest Research Institute add microspheres -- powder-sized capsules of air encased in plastic. The mixture then is poured into coffee can-sized molds and refrigerated, because synthetic chicken apparently will spoil and reek just like real meat if left out at room temperature. When the concoction has solidified, engineers at the institute have Federal Aviation Administration-approved fake birds ranging from 2 to 10 pounds -- a weight and mass that will mimic the impact of real birds when they are fired from the institute's giant compressed gas gun. The faux birds don't smell or taste much like chicken, but they splatter like the real thing when they are blown down the gun's 33-foot-long barrel and into revved-up airplane engines or propellers."

"A museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, has removed an ancient icon depicting Jesus Christ from display because the piece of art's 'energy field' reportedly has killed several staff members. A professor at the Hermitage Museum says he had complained about the effects of the icon for years, reported the <i>London Telegraph</i>. He claims it has led to the death of several supervisors in the facility. ... Some at the museum are unconvinced. '[Sapunov's] just a nutty professor,' Alexandra Kostsova, an icon specialist, was quoted by the Telegraph as saying. 'Only one of the workers in contact with the icon died, and she had cancer.'"

"The Defence Ministry on Wednesday announced that it will pay compensation to 11 Iraqis who were allegedly beaten by British soldiers during a raid in southern Iraq aimed at tracking down the killers of six Royal Military Police officers. ... However, the spokesperson said the payments did not mean the ministry accepted allegations that British soldiers had kicked and beaten the 11 men during the operation. 'We are going to make <i>ex-gratia</i> payments to the men. They were innocent. We have released them and sent a letter of apology,' the spokesperson said on condition of anonymity. ... The payments will be in the region of several hundred United States dollars, and there is not likely to be any further investigation into the matter, the spokesperson said."
