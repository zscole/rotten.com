"The rebels considered taking his eyes and legs but settled for his hands, nose, lips and ears. On his hospital bed, head swathed in bandages, Oryem is grateful they did not take his life. Three days earlier he was abducted from his sister's home in Oryang, a village in northern Uganda, and tied up by the side of a dirt road while six rebels took turns: an axe for the hands, a scalpel for the face and a machete-like tool called a panga for the legs. One of the younger rebels, a boy called Odel who had identified Oryem, 31, as a former soldier, persuaded his comrades to stop chopping his shins and to leave the eyes. 'They left me alive to feel the pain and to set an example to the others.'"

"Some hospitals have begun ensuring surgeons and nurses sign checklists and special forms before a single incision is made, and that the correct body part is marked in black marker before the patient is wheeled into the operating room. Canadian bone surgeons are already signing hips, legs and other body parts in a practice known as 'cutting through the initials.' In a letter in the current issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal, a family medicine resident at McMaster University says medical staff should go further by writing 'Cut me' on the correct limb, and 'Malpractice' on the other. 'Writing "Do not cut me" on the unaffected limb could lead to surgical errors if a drape is placed such that it covers the first two words.'"

Their job is to keep weapons and bombs off airplanes. Henderson and his employees have found themselves on the front lines of another battle: protecting the public from pilots who have been drinking."

"A study of several surveys into teenage girls' risk-taking behaviour has found 70 percent of young women engage in binge drinking -- consuming five or more drinks on one occasion -- and 19 per cent do so on a weekly basis. An alarming 22 percent of girls aged 14 to 19 drink between nine and 30 alcoholic drinks in a day. And twice the number of teenage girls use drugs, compared with boys."

"A ship sailing around Ireland as part of a reality television show sank off the coast of County Donegal less than a week into its voyage. Nine of the programme's contestants, who are bidding for a £70,000 prize, and two skippers were rescued when the tall ship Cabin Fever I hit rocks near Tory Island." No fatalities.

"Prince William has been involved in an amazing road-rage incident... A furious motorist -- an elderly man in a Land Rover Discovery -- argued with the Prince and then pursued him, before being forced off the road by armed Royal Protection officers. ... 'There was an argument between the Prince and the other driver who was obviously furious and pursued William's car sounding his horn,' a witness said. 'Then soon a Royal Protection car, a Vauxhall Omega with two plain clothes officers inside, chased the Discovery down a gravel track and forced him off the road.'"

"'When <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George</a> got on the board at Silver Screen in 1983, we didn't expect a whole lot,' says a formerly high-ranking Disney production executive who wished to remain anonymous. 'But it's funny how the squeaky wheel gets the grease.' ... 'He said he had two kinds of things he always liked to see,' asserts a junior White House aide. 'One was the fish-out-of-water story -- the nice guy, maybe not too bright, who gets stuck in unfamiliar circumstances. You don't have to look too far to figure out where that comes from. The other was the story where the uptight yuppie guy learns to relax with the help of a funny sidekick -- often a sidekick of color. <i>Sister Act</i> had that, and so did <i>Down and Out in Beverly Hills</i>. [Bush] just went nuts for that formula.'"
