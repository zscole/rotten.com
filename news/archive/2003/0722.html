In late summer in 1966, according to the affidavit, Shanley drove him to a cabin in the Blue Hills and performed a sex act on him that night. ... Shanley wrote a letter in his own defense, suggesting that the family was troubled and insisting 'God as my judge that I did not masturbate this boy here or anywhere else at the date or any other date, so help me God.'

"A fire broke out at the top of the Eiffel Tower Tuesday and smoke was seen billowing from the Paris monument. The fire started in a so-called technical room housing antenna equipment at the top of the tower, Paris police told CNN. Smoke curled from the third floor of the top level of the famous tower. The blaze appeared to be in an area inaccessible to tourists, and there were no immediate reports of injuries."

"Tears rolling down his face, Bachchan Singh Bahadur poured cups of melted butter on the wood fire of his father's funeral pyre on the outskirts of New Delhi. ... The 35-year-old government clerk could have used an electricity-powered crematorium less than half a mile away for just one-tenth of the price, but for him nothing would do except a wood-burning crematorium by the Yamuna River where the ashes would be tossed after cooling overnight. 'Unless the body is burned on a wood pyre, the soul does not get salvation,' he explained. ... Nearly 20,000 Hindus die each day in this nation of 1 billion people. Each cremation requires an average of 650 pounds of wood. The result is denuded forests, rivers clogging up with human ashes or even body parts -- and a wood trade said to be rife with corruption."

"Unaware that a live microphone was broadcasting their words around the Capitol, Assembly Democrats meeting behind closed doors debated <i>prolonging California's budget crisis</i> for political gain. Members of the coalition of liberal Democrats talked about slowing progress on the budget as a means of increasing pressure on Republicans. ... Some members of the group, including Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg, said if the budget crisis were extended, it could improve chances for a ballot initiative that would make it easier for the Democrats to raise taxes by lowering the threshold for passage from two-thirds to 55 percent."

"A high-ranking Arab-American FBI agent is taking the bureau to court, accusing it of racial discrimination for freezing him out of the Sept. 11 investigation. The suit described agent Bassem Youssef as the only polygraph examiner qualified to conduct interviews in Arabic, with extensive experience and Middle Eastern contacts culled from his days with the FBI in Saudi Arabia. Yet, the complaint said, he was kept away from any substantial investigations related to the hijacking attacks on New York and Washington. ... two months before Sept. 11, a 'walk-in' at one of the FBI's field offices said he had significant information about terrorist leader <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/crime/terrorists/osama-bin-laden/">Osama bin Laden</a>. The lawsuit said the field office requested that Youssef debrief the walk-in because of his expertise, but he did not end up handling the interview. The possible informant left without revealing whatever information he may have had."

"David Robert Thompson, a project engineer with aviation designer Burt Rutan's private space program, was killed when a kit airplane he had spent years building crashed during takeoff on its maiden flight. Thompson, 38, was departing Mountain Valley Airport Sunday morning when the single-engine plane fell back onto the runway and burst into flames. His wife and son were among witnesses. 'We went out to watch him take off. It was a mistake,' said longtime pilot Dick Reichel. 'His family was there, videotaping,' said Kern County deputy coroner Kelly Cowan."

"A man accused of having sex with a sheep used in a Charleston nativity scene has struck a deal with Kanawha County prosecutors that allowed him to stay out of jail. Joey Armstrong, 30, will serve two years of probation and be required to get some mental health care for breaking into a funeral home's manger scene and molesting an animal... The deal came despite pressure from animal rights advocates to send Armstrong to jail. A spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said the group is 'appalled' that Armstrong was getting off with what amounted to a slap on the wrist."
