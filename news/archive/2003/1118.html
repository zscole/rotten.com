"Officers raided <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a>'s Neverland Ranch yesterday, and a television network reported that authorities have a warrant to arrest the singer on child-molestation charges, possibly as soon as today. Last night, Diane Dimond of Court TV said that law-enforcement officials had told her on the condition of anonymity that 'there was not just a search warrant out there today at Neverland. There was also an arrest warrant. And had Michael Jackson been there, they would have put handcuffs on him and taken him to jail.' ... Court TV cited unidentified sources earlier in the day as saying the search warrant was tied to a sexual-abuse accusation from a 12- or 13-year-old boy."

"A Palestinian girl who was raped and impregnated by her two brothers was later murdered by her own mother - even though her daughter was the crime's innocent victim - in another of the disturbingly common, if vastly underreported, instances of 'honor killings.' ... Rofayda Qaoud was raped by her brothers, Fahdi, 22, and Ali, 20, in a bedroom they shared in the family's three-room house in the town of Abu Qash in the West Bank. When her mother found she had become pregnant, she insisted her daughter commit suicide, and even bought the unwed teen a razor so she could slash her own wrists. When the daughter refused, Amira Abu Hanhan Qaoud took matters into her own hands and murdered Rofayda to restore her family's 'honor.'"

"The U.S. military has begun leveling houses and buildings used by suspected Iraqi guerrilla fighters in a new tactic which is part of a more aggressive strategy aimed at crushing the anti-American insurgency, Pentagon officials said Tuesday. Pentagon officials rejected any comparison to the tactics employed by the Israeli military in the West bank and Gaza, saying the U.S. actions are not aimed at punishing sympathizers, but rather are aimed at eliminating legitimate military targets... The United States has used a number of methods to destroy buildings, everything from tanks to air strikes. Among the attack aircraft employed are F-15s, F-16s, AC-130 gunships, A-10 attack planes, and Apache helicopters."

"<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George Bush</a> was last night branded chicken for scrapping his speech to Parliament because he feared being heckled by anti-war MPs. The US president planned to give a joint address to the Commons and Lords during his state visit to Britain. But senior White House adviser Dr Harlan Ullman said: 'They would have loved to do it because it would have been a great photo-opportunity. But they were fearful it would to turn into a spectacle with Labour backbenchers walking out.' ... Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn said: 'This is yet another slight on this country by the President of the USA. The least he could do is subject himself to questions from MPs.' ... earlier this year, Bush was embarrassed when he was heckled by MPs in Australia." [<i>And let's not forget the time he <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=12713155&method=full&siteid=50143" target="_blank">canceled a speech</a> before the European Parliament because they wouldn't promise to give him a standing ovation, and refrain from any protests or heckling.</i>]
