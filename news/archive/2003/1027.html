<b>Viewership</b><br>
On the first full day this page went live, 100,000 people visited this Rotten
News page. Of course that was the day after the WTC attacks, so that number is
somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"Pressed by prosecutors, New York real estate heir Robert Durst testified Monday that he could not remember specifics of how he cut up the body of a neighbor he is accused of murdering. The millionaire said he did not know how long it took or what part of Morris Black's body he cut first. Durst said he used two saws and an ax that belonged to Black after drinking a fifth of Jack Daniels... Durst, who lived in squalor despite his millions, testified earlier that his neighbor was killed accidentally in a scuffle over a gun. He said he cut up Black in a panic, fearing police would not believe his story, and dumped the body parts in Galveston Bay... Durst, who sometimes posed as a mute woman while living on Galveston Island, said earlier that he and Black became good friends but had a falling out."

"The sicko New Jersey couple who starved their four sons apparently preferred their daughters - allowing them to pig out in front of the boys, authorities said. While the little girls could be seen frolicking in a small pool behind the family's house in the middle-class Philadelphia suburb of Collingswood in the summer, the tragic skin-and-bones boys were forced to wash their clothes in a bucket on the side of the house and clip the grass with small hand shears, neighbors said... The boys, who had been adopted between 1995 and 1997, were locked out of the kitchen and given only uncooked pancake batter, peanut butter and jelly and cereal to eat, officials said. The boys told authorities they thought they were getting more nutrients by also eating bits of the home's wallboard and insulation. Meanwhile, the girls - two adopted, ages 5 and 10, and a 12-year-old in the process of being adopted - were allowed to order Chinese takeout and chow down in front of the boys, authorities said."

"Pittsburgh boxing champion Paul Spadafora was charged Sunday with attempted murder, accused of shooting his girlfriend in the chest as they argued outside a McKees Rocks gas station... Police recovered a .38-caliber revolver at the scene and impounded Spadafora's Hummer H2. One bullet was missing, police said. Spadafora, known as 'The Pittsburgh Kid,' initially told detectives that he and his girlfriend had been attacked by a couple of black men and police released him, but the authorities issued an arrest warrant for Spadafora based on a statement given by the gas station attendant, who said he didn't see anyone else in the vicinity at the time of the shooting."

"A controversy has erupted in Italy over a court ruling ordering a state kindergarten to remove crucifixes from its classrooms... The judge ruled that the crucifixes showed 'the unequivocal desire by the state, when it comes to public education, to place the Catholic religion at the centre of the universe,' in disregard for other religions... The law requiring crucifixes to be hung in schools dates back to the 1920s, when Catholicism was state the religion in Italy. Although a revised accord between the Vatican and the Italian Government ended Catholicism's position as state religion in 1984, the crucifix law has never been repealed."

Animal rights activists had called for the animals to be slaughtered at sea. More than 5,000 died during the voyage. Eritrea has been facing serious food shortages caused by drought and is heavily dependent on international aid. The news is likely to be especially welcome for Muslims in Eritrea, as sheep are traditionally slaughtered during the month of Ramadan which began on Monday."

Mr. Bush's remarks and subsequent comments today from his press secretary suggested that the White House may ultimately refuse the commission's demand for access to the documents, setting up a possible showdown between the White House and the independent investigators. Last week, Mr. Kean said for the first time that he was prepared to issue a subpoena and risk a courtroom battle with the White House if the documents were not turned over within weeks... Other members of the panel said today that they supported Mr. Kean in his threat to issue a subpoena for the White House documents."

"For decades, the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/religion/mormonism/">Mormon Church</a> kept a large collection of the artifacts in its Salt Lake City museum, but never formally claimed them to be genuine. This past summer, after scholars examined the relics and declared them <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/hoaxes/">fakes</a>, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints donated the 797 objects to the Michigan Historical Museum, which will display them next month. The relics were once hailed as the greatest archaeological discoveries since Pompeii. But there are many clues they are really fakes, Michigan State Archaeologist John Halsey told <i>The Grand Rapids Press</i>... 'It is arguably the largest archaeological fraud ever in this country, and the longest running,' Halsey said."
