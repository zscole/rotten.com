On the first full day this page went live, 100,000 people visited this Rotten

somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"A Colombian proposal to amnesty leaders of right-wing paramilitary groups responsible for some of the worst massacres of the country's decades-long civil war has been strongly assailed by a major U.S. human-rights researcher. In a release issued by Human Rights Watch (HRW), Robin Kirk, the author of <i>More Terrible Than Death: Massacres, Drugs and America's War in Colombia</i>, called on the administration of U.S. President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/
">George W. Bush</a> to cut off aid to the South American country if the proposal is adopted. ... The Bush administration, Uribe's biggest foreign booster, has not commented publicly on the proposal, but the <i>New York Times</i> reported Monday that it had provided advice to Bogotá on drafting legislation that would implement the scheme's main components."

Glenn Nutter, who also lost five of his fingers, claims his shocking injuries were caused when medical staff failed to correctly diagnose his condition and then administered excessive amounts of an anaesthetic drug that had devastating side-effects. The 42-year-old former mining industry worker is suing Mount Isa Base Hospital and Cairns Base Hospital for negligence over the 1998 incident, when doctors allegedly failed to diagnose a potentially lethal streptococcal infection quickly enough. ... It is further alleged doctors later administered 500mg of the drug thiopentone, causing Mr Nutter to suffer up to seven heart attacks within three minutes of being injected."

"William Fitzgerald says his neighborhood looks like a 'war zone.' Every night from June to August -- as well as weekends and holidays during the off-season -- the nearby <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/travel/disneyland/">Disneyland Resort</a> sets off a massive fireworks display. Within minutes, a 100-foot-tall cloud of smoke rolls through the streets and homes in Fitzgerald’s neighborhood. ... 'Our estimates are 200 rounds going off each night,' Fitzgerald said. 'Afterward, you are blanketed in a big smoke cloud for 10 or 15 minutes. Every piece of exposed metal on my property is rusted. This sulfuric acid is very corrosive. You can see lines on the cars where the paint has peeled away. Common sense tells you not to set off fireworks every day in a heavily populated area where the smoke hurts children and people with asthma.'"

"US telco giant SBC has hit back at the Recording Industry Association of America's legal blitz against music lovers. In testimony before the Senate this week, SBC's counsel Jim Ellis said that the RIAA was making an end run around the constitution by issuing a blitz of subpoenas with no judicial oversight. Ellis argued that the legal tactics deployed by the RIAA could be adopted by Net stalkers and child molesters."

"A man imprisoned for writing <b>fictitious</b> stories of child torture and molestation has been released from jail two months after an appeals court threw out his child pornography conviction. ... Dalton, 24, is believed to be the first person in the United States successfully prosecuted for child pornography for writings rather than images. The stories, which prosecutors say were made-up and never acted on, were about three children, ages 10 and 11, being caged in a basement, molested and tortured."
