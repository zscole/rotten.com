"Here, according to the few locals prepared to talk, the elders of an eccentric breakaway <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/religion/mormonism/">Mormon</a> sect have prepared a last stand against further interference by Utah state authorities - stockpiling food and, some say, weapons, as if in readiness for a siege. The godfearing polygamists of Hildale and neighbouring Colorado City, members of the Fundamentalist Church of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) have good reason to be jumpy. Last week, for the first time in 40 years, the state of Utah jailed a local resident for bigamy. Rodney Holm, a powerful local police officer, will serve a year in prison. He was also found guilty of two charges of sexual misconduct with a minor... The apparent fear of a <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/cult/david-koresh/">Waco</a>-style confrontation with the Hildale polygamists, which the authorities fear could culminate in a serious loss of life, has seen them left alone."

But the Army filed no charges, and allowed soldiers who were under suspicion of committing war crimes to resign. The newspaper said the accusations against the unit included killing women and children, torturing prisoners and severing ears and scalps for souvenirs. The paper said the Army's investigation of Tiger Force found 27 soldiers who said the severing of ears from dead Vietnamese was an accepted practice. One soldier told the newspaper that troops would wear necklaces of ears to scare Vietnamese civilians."

The trial was halted as [Harry Caldwell] began to hyper-ventilate in the dock as his wife confessed she had <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/abortion/">aborted</a> his baby... Laura Caldwell, 33, had told the jury yesterday how Caldwell had arrived at their home shortly after Louisa had returned from an overnight visit to her natural father. She said he 'had evil in his eyes' as he picked the girl up by the ankles and smashed her head against a wall. He took a kitchen knife and threatened to kill her, holding it against her throat... When asked why Caldwell would want to kill Louisa, her mother replied: 'Because he is evil. Evil is the only word to describe him. He's not got a soul. He can't have to kill a defenceless baby.'"

"A disciplinary panel has recommended that an officer be fired for using police data bases to review the personal records of Halle Berry, Kobe Bryant, Sean Penn, Sharon Stone and other celebrities. Investigators say Officer Kelly Chrisman used police databases hundreds of times between 1994 and 2000 to look up celebrity records. The Los Angeles Police Department's Board of Rights found him guilty Friday of 15 of 22 counts of misusing department computers... Chrisman, 35, testified that he looked up the information as part of a project to map the homes of movie stars, corporate executives, politicians and others on the city's West Side. He said the mapping was needed to help police handle problems such as celebrity stalkers. Police officials responded that there was no such mapping project."

Bush</a> has been trapped in a clay pot and tossed into a river in northern Thailand - or at least his spirit has after being cursed by hundreds of farmers protesting US agriculture policy. A photograph of the US leader was sealed inside a pot amid black magic mantra chants, then tossed into the Ping River Friday by demonstrators... A respected elder performed the voodoo rites, inscribing ancient Khmer scripts on the pot, aimed at trapping the spirit of the US president."

You would be hard-pressed to find a country that is more feverish in its attempts to learn English than South Korea.

The young man was diagnosed with eosinophilic meningitis, or swelling of the brain membranes, five weeks after eating two slugs in 2001, the Medical Journal of Australia reports today... the meningitis was caused by a worm found in rat lungs, but carried as larvae in slugs and snails."

Especially if you're the personnel director for the Board of Elections, charged with overseeing equal-employment issues and discrimination complaints... A burly man with bushy shoulder-length white hair and a full beard, Donahue said he is a motorcycle enthusiast and to him, the Confederate flag is 'just a symbol of the freedom of the road.' After the hearing, Donahue said he would remove the decal when on the job. When a reporter noted that Donahue also was wearing a lapel pin depicting a biker with a tiny Confederate flag, he quickly took it off."

"DeAngelo Bailey had sued <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/eminem/">Eminem</a>, 31, for $1 million, claiming that the lyrics to 'Brain Damage,' from the rapper's 1999 <i>Slim Shady</i> LP, had falsely accused him of assaulting Eminem during their school days. But Michigan judge Deborah Servitto threw out the case, resorting to rap-style lyrics to explain her decision:

<blockquote><font size=-1><i>Mr Bailey complains that his rap is trash, so he's seeking compensation in the form of cash/ Bailey thinks he's entitled to some monetary gain, because Eminem used his name in vain/ The lyrics are stories no one would take as fact, they're an exaggeration of a childish act/ It is therefore this court's ultimate position, that Eminem is entitled to summary disposition.
</i></font></blockquote>

Mr Bailey's stunned lawyer, Byron Nolen, said: 'I don't know how the Court of Appeals would look at something like that.'"
