He tells me: 'One day, we captured two women, the wives of the Interahamwe, and the commander told me to kill them. Six of us raped them. Then we stabbed them to death with machetes. It was cheaper than bullets. They begged us to spare them, but we laughed. We had orders. We cut out their hearts to take to the commander. Their babies were aged three months, a boy; a one-year-old girl; another boy, two; and the last aged three. We killed them and used their bodies to make medicine. I boiled their feet and arms to grind and put in bottles. The potion has the power to stop bullets.'"

The judge stopped Cha within minutes because the family of a girl and her great-grandmother injured during the shooting said Cha was threatening them with death.

The naked body of Susan Brennan, 32, was found strangled, her hands and feet bound by electrical wire and a rope around her neck, in an isolated lot in southwest Philadelphia on Monday. ... Authorities believe Burley may have covered the body with peanut butter in order to attract rodents, so as to get the body to decompose more quickly."

Larry Johnson, former chief operating officer of Alcor Life Extension Foundation, ... said he observed 'horrific' activities relating to the handling of Williams' remains and other disturbing Alcor practices. ... The site asks for donations of as little as a dollar to help support his battle to 'free Ted' from Alcor. Initially, viewers were offered the chance to pay a $20 'donation' to see 20 photographs 'documenting the fate of Ted Williams.'

"Armed with a budget of $28 million, the missionary organization Jews for Jesus is launching an aggressive campaign beginning this week to convert Jews in Cleveland to Christianity. Cleveland is one of three 'red letter' U.S. cities targeted for 2003 in what the group's Web site notes 'might be the largest Jewish evangelistic effort since (the) first century.' In a campaign slated to continue until 2005, the group plans to 'launch an outreach in every city worldwide that has a Jewish population of 25,000 or more.' That would entail 60 different cities around the world, half of which are in the United States."

"<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a> is so desperate to be 'normal' he hired a supermarket and got friends and family to pretend to be shoppers as he wandered the aisles filling his trolley.  The singer's bizarre attempt to experience 'reality' included getting his cousins to dress up as bag boys to load his groceries. The surreal shopping experience was filmed for the entertainer's private collection of home movies."

While stressing this was <b>not</b> another outbreak of SARS, which killed more than 40 people in the Toronto area this year, officials said they were treating it like the deadly form of pneumonia until they learn more about it. ... 'There have been seven deaths, although only three of them have been directly associated with a respiratory illness,' Peck told a news briefing."

"Tim Huffman was convicted of indecent exposure because of a skit on his cable-access TV show in Grand Rapids, Michigan. One sketch featured a male organ, with a face drawn on it. The talking organ told jokes, but one woman in the audience wasn't laughing. She complained to a friend in the county prosecutor's office."

"Two Dutch nationals were arrested in Vietnam's southern metropolis of Ho Chi Minh City after being caught taking part in an orgy with six prostitutes, police and consular officials said today. ... The two men and the six women, aged 16 to 25, were arrested. Police also confiscated a box of what they believed was Viagra, 17 pornographic VCDs, one laptop, the video camera and 16 pornographic pictures. While checking the contents of the laptop they discovered hardcore pictures of European couples engaged in sexual activity, as well as video clips of the two men involved in previously-recorded naked romps with the same prostitutes."

"Scientists have discovered the world's toughest life form. The single-celled microbe, called 'strain 121' for the moment, can survive at a scorching 130C -- higher than the boiling point of water and nearly 20 degrees higher than the previous record holder. It raises the possibility that life began on earth earlier than currently thought."
