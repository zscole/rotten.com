"A senior Japanese politician has been forced to apologise after sparking outrage by appearing to condone rape. Seiichi Ota, a lawmaker with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said at a debate on Japan's declining birth rate that at least gang rapists had a healthy appetite for sex. 'Gang rape shows the people who do it are still vigorous, and that is OK. I think that might make them close to normal,' the former cabinet minister told a symposium. ... The remarks came as the veteran politician attributed the country's declining population to a lack of courage among Japanese men to enter into married life, the <i>Mainichi Shimbun</i> reported."

"Senator Guy W. Glodis has angered Muslims and a civil rights group over a flier he sent to fellow senators that says terrorist attacks could be deterred if convicted Muslim extremists were buried with pig entrails. The flier, which Glodis's 39 colleagues received Wednesday, said an execution of Muslim extremists in the Philippines was ordered by General John Joseph 'Black Jack' Pershing before <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wwi/">World War I</a>, in which the terrorists were shot with bullets dipped in pigs' blood, then buried with 'pigs' blood, entrails, etc.' According to the flier, contact with the blood and entrails of pigs 'instantly barred' Muslims from paradise, dooming them to hell. It said news of the burial deterred other terrorist attacks for 'the next forty-two years.' 'Maybe it is time for this segment of history to repeat itself, maybe in Iraq,' the flier concluded."

"A distraught Baldwin mother told a federal judge yesterday how she had had to listen to her son's death agonies after he took a highly toxic and banned weight-loss chemical, [Dinitrophenol]. 'He kept saying, "<i>I had no idea it would be as bad as this.</i>" ... He started to yell. He started to scream. He kept screaming. He was in terrible, terrible pain.' ... Despite its toxicity and illegality for human consumption, DNP is widely touted on the Internet for weight loss. Eric threatened to leave home and go to a motel to take it, so Perrin reluctantly agreed to observe him for danger signs while he used it, she testified. He died hours after taking it for the first time."

Prosecutors said the woman alerted police after meeting Manuel through the chat group. She told authorities Manuel had offered to strangle her during sex, dig a grave for her in a state forest and bury her with a rose on her chest."
