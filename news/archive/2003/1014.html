somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"Evidence has emerged linking Washington sniper John Allen Muhammad with an Islamic terror group. Muhammad has been connected to Al Fuqra, a cult devoted to spiritual purification through violence. The group has been linked to British shoe bomber Richard Reid and the murderers of American journalist Daniel Pearl in Pakistan last year... investigators suspect the 42-year-old former soldier was an Islamic terrorist and believe his insanity plea is a cover story to disguise his support for fundamentalists."

The state's death penalty has the dubious honour of being second only to Texas. In terms of upholding convictions on appeal, Virginia holds the national record.

"The trials of three top officials in the party that ruled Rwanda during the government-orchestrated genocide in 1994 will begin at a special United Nations tribunal next month, the court announced. At the time, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was president of the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND), whose Interahamwe militia carried out much of the killings in 1994, when up to a million Rwandan Tutsis and Hutus opposed to the genocide were slaughtered. Ngirumpatse will appear at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda together with MRND former vice president Edouard Karemera and former secretary general Joseph Nzirorera on charges of conspiracy to commit genocide and crimes against humanity."

"The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday confirmed terrorists have discussed using stuffed animals, pillows and clothing to smuggle explosives aboard commercial airliners. The explosive - nitrocellulose - is a propellant for ammunition and some rockets and is extremely flammable when packed in a sturdy container... Airport screeners have been told to examine all items that show evidence of tampering and look for suspicious behavior or dress that would not be appropriate to the season or the weather... Homeland Security says <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">al Qaeda</a> training manuals that were confiscated suggest operatives were trained to make nitrocellulose and that adding nitroglycerine helps make the mixture more sensitive to ignition."

He saw <i>A Few Good Men</i> where Tom plays a military lawyer and he believes in his heart that he will mount a brilliant defence for him.'

"Witnesses at scores of executions have said death by lethal injection is a remarkably calm, almost peaceful affair. But death penalty opponents have launched a campaign to prove that the impression of calm may be false, caused by the use of a powerful muscle relaxant that paralyses those being executed. The drug, pancuronium bromide, is banned in some states for use in putting down pets and strongly discouraged by the American Veterinary Medical Association with a warning that if used without perfect anaesthesia an animal 'may perceive pain and distress after it is immobilised.' ... Lawyers for Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman, a Tennessee death row inmate, asked the judge to rule on the legality of using pancuronium bromide in his case. While the judge allowed the drug's use, she found that, when the relaxant is used, 'the subject gives all the appearances of a serene expiration when actually the subject is feeling and perceiving the excruciatingly painful ordeal of death by lethal injection.' ... Witnesses at a hearing for Abdur'Rahman testified that an injection of potassium chloride would trigger excruciating pain, so that any failure with the initial anaesthetic would leave the condemned man conscious, paralysed and in agony. One witness, Dr Mark Heath, an anaesthesiologist who teaches at Columbia University, told the <i>New York Times</i> that the pain would be like being trapped in 'a chemical tomb.'"

Reverend Baker was killed and cooked by the people of Tui Navatusila on 21 July, 1867, after he took a comb out of a chief's hair. It is forbidden to touch the head of a chief in Fiji.

In August, a San Bernardino County court ordered him to enter a six-month drug treatment program after his April 13 arrest at the scene of a collision. King had crashed a Ford Expedition into a house on Pepper Avenue in Rialto. Officers reported King was under the influence of PCP and had been traveling at speeds up to 100 miles an hour...

"A 12-year-old boy came home and told his mother that he had earned money by being hit by a car. The 12-year-old from Katten, Lørenskog, was thrown over the steering bar of his bike, rolled over the hood of the car before he ended up crashing his head on the asphalt... When he got out his cell phone to call his mother, the woman gave him the money, told him to buy some sweets, and suggested that they should just forget the whole ordeal and the dent in the car... The boy got a severe concussion as a result of the accident."

"Rep. George Nethercutt said yesterday that Iraq's reconstruction is going better than is portrayed by the news media, citing his recent four-day trip to the country. <i>'The story of what we've done in the postwar period is remarkable,'</i> Nethercutt, R-Wash., told an audience of 65 at a noon meeting at the University of Washington's Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs. <i>'It is a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day.'</i> ... Nethercutt is a member of the House Appropriations Committee that approved President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a>'s $87 billion request for military and reconstruction expenses in Iraq and Afghanistan."

"Government scientists have discovered that genetically modified oil seed rape cannot be contained by separating it from fields of conventional crops, after bees carried the pollen up to 16 miles away. A second piece of research has shown that once GM oil seed rape has been grown in a field, it would be 16 years before a conventional crop could be grown in the same field without fear of contamination of more than 0.9%, the threshold for claiming that the crop was GM free."

"A cattleman raises a rifle to his shoulder and shoots a cow point-blank between the eyes, sending the animal crumpling to the ground. The killing was meant to draw attention to the plight of cattle producers hurt by mad-cow disease. Instead, the stunt appears to have backfired. The Canadian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and television stations that aired the footage yesterday said they were deluged by callers who said the farmer's action was barbaric... The scene also shows other cattle farmers cheering and raising their arms in victory after the Holstein is felled, a gunshot hole clearly visible between its eyes."

"When Clonaid, a fringe scientific group, claimed it produced the world's first <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/cloning/">cloned</a> baby, international news media jumped all over the story... Two <i>Journal de Montréal</i> reporters who infiltrated the Raelian movement described members mocking the media that covered the cloning announcement... 'Even if you want to think we only did that for publicity, it's marvellous,' <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/cult/rael/">Rael</a> told the <i>Journal de Montréal</i>. 'If that's it, we are publicity geniuses. And if it is true, we are scientific geniuses, too.' In a two-page weekly Raelian bulletin obtained by <i>The Gazette</i>, Rael said he believed Boisselier's claim. If false, it had at least drawn attention to the movement, he suggested. 'Even if Brigitte's announcement turns out to be a joke (and I don't think so), I'm sure all the new Raelians will warmly thank Brigitte for this "white lie" that enabled them to join us.'"

"Something very odd happened in the mid-term elections in Georgia last November. On the eve of the vote, opinion polls showed Roy Barnes, the incumbent Democratic governor, leading by between nine and 11 points. In a somewhat closer, keenly watched Senate race, polls indicated that Max Cleland, the popular Democrat up for re-election, was ahead by two to five points against his Republican challenger, Saxby Chambliss... But then the results came in, and all of Georgia appeared to have been turned upside down... Last November, the state became the first in the country to conduct an election entirely with touchscreen voting machines, after lavishing $54m on a new system that promised to deliver the securest, most up-to-date, most voter-friendly election in the history of the republic. The machines, however, turned out to be anything but reliable. With academic studies showing the Georgia touchscreens to be poorly programmed, full of security holes and prone to tampering, and with thousands of similar machines from different companies being introduced at high speed across the country, computer voting may, in fact, be US democracy's own 21st-century nightmare."
