"Ciudad Juarez is known as 'the city of the dead girls'. In 10 years almost 400 women have been murdered in this city on the border between Mexico and El Paso, Texas, and the killings continue... more than a third of the women were raped before death. Most victims are tortured and mutilated. Sometimes the killer leaves a signature; a breast or a nipple is sliced off. The bodies are then dumped in wasteland... 'Five men from Juarez and one from Tijuana who get together and kill women in what can only be described as blood sport. Some of those involved are prominent men with important political connections - untouchables.' [Newspaper journalist Diana Washington Valdez] alleges at least 100 women have been killed by these men, of whom all but one are multi-millionaires. They have political connections going all the way to President Vicente Fox, and some have allegedly made contributions to Fox's presidential campaign."

Bush was unharmed and authorities said later she had never intended to hurt the president. Authorities swarmed the car with weapons drawn and took away the driver and her children. Secret Service and local law enforcement investigators concluded after interviewing her that she had no intention of harming the president, said Ann Roman, a Secret Service spokeswoman. A law enforcement official identified the driver as Betina Mixon, 29, of Horn Lake. Mixon, a nurse's aide and the mother of three sons, had been under stress recently because of marital problems and a hysterectomy, said her friend Amy Graves, of Walls."

"<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/donald-rumsfeld/">Donald Rumsfeld</a> says he does not know whether he has lost his mojo... 'Have you lost your mojo?' a reporter asked him during a Pentagon briefing. Mr Rumsfeld said he has not consulted a dictionary - as he did for words such as 'slog', about which he has sparred with reporters - but has spoken with an aide who had. 'And they asked me that, and I said, "I don't know what it means." And they said, "In 1926 or something, it had to do with jazz music."'

"People with <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/bodily-functions/pissing/">urinary</a> incontinence could one day use a remote control to keep their bodily functions in check. Scientists in Australia say they are close to making replacement sphincters operable by remote control... A small electrical stimulator, similar to a heart pacemaker, is also implanted to give the user control over the muscle. The patient can then use a remote control to operate the muscle when they wish to go to the bathroom."
