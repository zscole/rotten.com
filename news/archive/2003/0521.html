"The Justice Department has used many of the antiterrorism powers granted after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to pursue defendants for crimes unrelated to terrorism, including drug violations, credit card fraud, and bank theft, according to a government report.

...

Although the Patriot Act was passed in response to Sept. 11, the report shows that prosecutors have used many of the law's powers to pursue cases not related to terrorism. The report cites a case in which prosecutors were able to use the Patriot Act to seize stolen funds that a fugitive lawyer had stashed in bank accounts in Belize."

"Children are being trafficked into domestic service in Britain to clean houses and do chores without pay. The victims are mostly west African girls, lured on the promise of a Western education, only to find themselves forced to do heavy chores for wealthy families.

It is thought that a significant percentage of up to 10,000 largely west African children thought to enter the UK for private fostering are in fact destined for an underground world of domestic service. 'They don't speak the language, and probably wouldn't go to school,' said a spokesman for Unicef."

"A Texas monk is being hailed as a hero Wednesday after saving a female police officer's life during a struggle for control of her gun, according to a Local 6 News report.

...

Police said Patrick Coughlan, who is a monk, noticed the scuffle between the suspect and officer and raced to the woman's rescue. He grabbed the weapon and ordered the man to the ground at gunpoint.

...

Couglin said that he's not looking for praise just doing what the boss (God) told him to do." That's right -- even the <i>monks</i> in Texas are badasses.

Later, he said: 'I am convinced that not very far from President Bush and his entourage are people that are not just willing, but actively working toward that ... The brother (Jeb Bush) was very open, calling publicly in Florida to do in the neighborhood, in the nation of Cuba, what you just did to Iraq.'"

At the detention hearing, FBI Special Agent Daniel W. Chadwick testified that Cherry acknowledged hitting Destiny with a belt and extension cord as well as her open hand, claiming she did so because the girl was slacking in doing her homework.

...

Asked by the prosecutor why a 4-year-old would be doing homework, Chadwick said Cherry told him Destiny had seen her siblings doing homework and wanted to do some. He said Cherry made up some for her. 'I never got a sufficient explanation for why this homework was being done at 1 o'clock in the morning,' said Chadwick."

A man who inadvertently exposed the gun he was carrying to a bank teller during a robbery should not have been convicted of armed robbery, according to a federal appeals court. "Deshon Rene Odom carried a loaded revolver in the waistband of his pants while he and an accomplice robbed a Los Angeles-area bank in 1996, but he did not brandish the weapon or even mention it to employees. A manager noticed the gun only when Odom raised his jacket to stuff away a pillowcase full of stolen cash. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said Tuesday in a written ruling that that Odom should have been convicted of unarmed bank robbery -- which carries a lesser prison term -- instead of armed robbery." That seems rather counterintuitive.

In a bio of the New York Times journalist, we learn a lot about the guy who made a living making shit up. Among other things, his cleanliness habits. "His apartment in Brooklyn was littered with broken furniture and rotting food, his landlord said; there was fungus, and mold. When he moved out in the fall of 2002, the place was in such sordid condition his landlord considered taking him to small-claims court to recoup damages. 'It was real filth,' the landlord told NEWSWEEK. 'Imagine using a bathroom for two-and-a-half years and never cleaning it.'"

"The Pentagon made an interesting choice when it hired a U.S. company to build a small wireless phone network in Iraq: MCI, aka WorldCom Inc., perpetrator of the biggest accounting fraud in American business and not exactly a big name in cellular service. ... 'We don't understand why MCI would be awarded this business given its status as having committed the largest corporate fraud in history,' said AT&T Corp. spokesman Jim McGann. ... 'I was curious about it, because the last time I looked, MCI's never built out a wireless network,' said Len Lauer, head of Sprint Corp.'s wireless division. ... The contract with WorldCom -- which plans to adopt the name of its MCI long distance unit when it emerges from bankruptcy -- has prompted grumbling in the telecommunications industry from people who say it was not put up for bids. 'We were not aware of it until it showed up in some news reports,' Motorola spokesman Norm Sandler said." Somebody up there likes WorldCom, despite defrauding investors of $11 billion.

"David Friedman, a/k/a Silly Billy, is the city's -- and possibly the country's -- most famous children's birthday party clown. Silly Billy has often been featured in fluffy articles, but there are things about his family's past that are not fluffy at all. In the mid 1980s, the Friedmans of Great Neck, Long Island, were caught up in a sex scandal of epic proportions. The case was widely publicized at the time, but a new documentary offers a more intimate portrait of this tragic clan -- a Franny and Zooey-esque collection of neurotic but gentle eccentrics, at once brilliant and doomed."

"An Indian city where an abandoned baby was mauled by dogs last year has installed an electronic buzzer system at a hospital to let parents dump unwanted infants safely, a newspaper reported. The 'baby-abandonment machine' at the hospital in the southern city of Trivandrum features doors that open automatically when a person enters from the roadside. After the child is placed in the cradle and the baby carrier goes down the steps, a beeper goes off to alert attendants."
