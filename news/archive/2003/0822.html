<b>Viewership</b><br>
On the first full day this page went live, 100,000 people visited this Rotten

somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"A federal judge on Friday slammed Fox News' trademark infringement lawsuit against Al Franken and his publisher Penguin Group and refused to stop the sale of the liberal satirist's new book that pokes fun at the network and host <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/pundits/bill-oreilly/">Bill O'Reilly</a>. Fox charged that Franken had violated its trademarked phrase 'fair and balanced' by including it on the cover of his book entitled <i>Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them</i>.... 'There are hard cases and there are easy cases. This is an easy case,' said U.S. District Judge Denny Chin. 'This case is wholly without merit both factually and legally.' ... [He] pointed out that the word 'Lies' in the title is printed in large red letters next to a photo of O'Reilly. He said that there was no likelihood that book buyers would think that the sponsor is Fox or O'Reilly."

"The Israeli authorities have made every effort to keep its very existence secret. And even now that its existence has been revealed, the state refuses to answer the many questions of the world and of the Israeli public: <i>Where is the facility? Who is being held there, why, and for how long? Were they tried before being locked up in Camp 1391, or are they awaiting trial? What are their conditions of incarceration?</i> ... As far as is known, the 1391 site is the only detention facility whose detainees don't know where they are. If they ask, the warders may answer, 'on the moon,' or 'in outer space,' or 'outside the borders of Israel.'

In the robbery at the Nanuet Mall, $1.6 million was stolen and a security guard was killed. Two police officers were gunned down when the truck, with Boudin in the passenger seat and fellow radical David Gilbert at the wheel, was stopped at a roadblock in Nyack and the gang burst from the back of the vehicle with automatic weapons firing."
