"The United States closed its embassy through the weekend in Oslo after a purported <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">al-Qaida</a> threat against Norway that some thought was likely meant instead for neighboring Denmark. The Arab satellite station Al-Jazeera aired an audio tape Wednesday purportedly by <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/crime/terrorists/ayman-al-zawahiri/">Ayman al-Zawahri</a>, the top lieutenant of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/crime/terrorists/osama-bin-laden/">Osama bin Laden</a>, urging attacks on the United States, Britain, Australia and, surprisingly, Norway. "Don't allow Americans, Britons, Australians, Norwegians or any other crusaders, who are the killers of your brothers in Iraq, to live in your countries, enjoy your resources and corrupt the earth," he said.

...

Norway, known as a global peacemaker and home of the Nobel peace prize, seemed an unlikely target considering it didn't support the U.S.-led war against Iraq. But Denmark, like Britain and Australia, was part of the U.S.-led coalition."

Jamar was bludgeoned in the head with an unknown object and died in the hospital two months after the attack.

Disease-causing microbes -- such as foot-and-mouth disease -- are readily available in countries where they naturally infect crops or livestock. They can be 'weaponized' easily, in some cases by simply walking onto a farm with contaminated shoes. Such an attack might be confused with a natural outbreak of disease, making it difficult to detect while providing a terrorist with plenty of time to spread microbes elsewhere and escape. ... Successful attacks could trigger quarantines, food shipment cutoffs, destruction of exposed animals, public panic and huge losses to the $230 billion-a-year American agriculture industry."

"NASA could have launched another shuttle to rescue the Columbia astronauts if it had realized the severity of the wing damage early on and decided it was worth the extreme risk to the second ship and crew, the chief accident investigator said Friday.

...

In the days after the Feb. 1 tragedy, NASA managers insisted nothing could have been done to fix Columbia's wing and save its seven astronauts. But earlier this week, NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe said he would have strongly considered sending Atlantis to the astronauts' rescue, even if it meant losing another shuttle and crew."

"A new poll suggests most Ontario residents regard racial profiling as a legitimate tool in the battles against crime, terrorism and the spread of infectious diseases such as <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/epidemics/sars/">SARS</a>. 'It shows that Canadians are torn between liberal democratic principles, which say everyone should be treated as an individual and not as a member of a group, and practical realities,' said Compas president Conrad Winn. The practice of using race to identify people who allegedly have a statistically higher chance of committing a crime or an act of terrorism remains controversial."
