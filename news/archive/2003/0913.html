"'Without exaggerating, I was raped at last three times a week,' said the 20-year-old daughter of murdered man at Nedenes tingrett Thursday. In court she was asked if that was more than a thousand times during a decade. 'Yes, but it feels like much more,' answered the daughter. Bashkim Hasani was stabbed to death by his children when he was in the hospital in December 2002. ... The 20-year-old told the court about rapes in the family home, at his workshop, in the woods and on trips. ... For a long time, she was forced to watch porn movies with him because he wanted her to learn about sexual intercourse. She further explained that her father had harassed her by inviting her to bring her lesbian girlfriend for a threesome."

"Children were present when police raided the All For One Day Care, but officers took 'special precautions to handle the situation without harming the children,' Lockhart said. Officers said they had made an earlier drug purchase at the day care -- also while children were present -- which prompted the raid. Inside the facility, police said they found $7,000 worth of crack cocaine, nearly 2 grams of which was within reach of a 4-month-old child. They also found two loaded guns inside the house. Officers said one gun, a 9 mm pistol, had the hammer cocked back and was accessible to children in the day care."

But Wolfowitz -- an architect of U.S. policy in Iraq -- said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press that he had misspoken. ... Wolfowitz said he was referring to only one man -- bin Laden supporter Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, one of the few names that <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration officials previously have cited to assert links between Al Qaeda and Iraq before the war. 'Zarqawi is actually the guy I was referring to -- should have been more precise,' Wolfowitz said Friday. 'It's not a great many -- it's one of bin Laden's key associates -- probably better referred to that way than a key lieutenant.' ...

"Internet addiction among New Zealand youth is on the rise. ... New Zealand's cyber psychologist Nathan Gaunt said at least one New Zealand teenager had tried to kill themselves this year after their computer was disconnected by their parents. ... School counsellors were seeing students who fell asleep in class because they had spent the night on the Internet, or were skipping school to play computer games. One teenage boy was caught after spending 19 hours on the Internet." [<i>In medio stat virtus.</i>]

"Longwood is an almost all African-American school on Chicago's South Side. The school had arranged to play a road game against Stronghurst Southern as a form of cultural exchange. The game was forfeited, however, because of Stronghurst Southern's ritual of carrying a Confederate flag onto the field after each touchdown by one of its players. ... [Stronghurst] offered to have the flag removed for Saturday's game, but Longwood decided to forfeit anyway, because some Stronghurst Southern fans might miss the flag and make comments that could lead to a tense situation."

"Republican <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> has denounced illegal immigration in his bid to become California's next governor, but the Austrian native may have stretched the bounds of United States law to secure his own ticket to America in the 1960s. ... Schwarzenegger came to the United States in 1968 on a B-1 visa, which allows visiting athletes to compete and train, but bars them from drawing a salary from an American company. But in his 1977 autobiography, Schwarzenegger said he reached a deal with a legendary figure in the bodybuilding industry <i>'to pay me a weekly salary in exchange for my information and being able to use photographs of me in his magazine.'</i> That arrangement, said a half-dozen immigration attorneys across the nation, appears to have violated the terms of his visa. ... Schwarzenegger told campaign aides this week that he does not recall earning a salary during his first year in America, even though he wrote about it in his autobiography and the arrangement has been reported in accounts over the decades. ... Schwarzenegger declined to be interviewed or release immigration records that detail his employment history in the United States."

"After a grenade exploded inside his Humvee in Iraq, Marine Staff Sgt. Bill Murwin was treated at a military hospital in Germany and spent four weeks at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Part of his left foot was amputated. His medical care was free, but the government billed him $243 for the food. Then, just three days after he received his first bill for the hospital food in Germany, he got a stern letter saying the bill was overdue. It warned that his account would be referred to a collection agency. Murwin, like thousands of other military personnel hospitalized every year, is expected to reimburse the government $8.10 per day for food."

"Influential researchers and academic organizations complain that inquiry has been hindered by new anti-terrorist laws, tightened national security and stricter immigration practices. In one telling situation, 32 scientists and editors connected to some of the most respected scientific journals have agreed to self-censor any advances they think might compromise national security. 'That's a chilling example of knowing whatever you do might not get published because an editor might decide that it will look bad for <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/john-ashcroft/">John Ashcroft</a>,' said Barry Bloom, dean of Harvard's School of Public Health."
