The U.S.-born former Baptist pastor also argues that the gay-rights movement's recent successes in areas like same-sex marriage stem from a 'well-orchestrated... conspiracy' that began in the 1960s. The conspiracy included the seduction and recruitment of young boys in playgrounds and locker rooms and the deliberate infiltration of North America's judiciary, schools, the religious community, and the entertainment industry, he said."

He threatened to shut down Open Society's Georgia offices, saying it was not Mr. Soros's business 'to get involved in the political processes.' ... Meanwhile, Mr. Saakashvili, the man expected to replace Mr. Shevardnadze, has a relationship with Mr. Soros that dates back to late 2000, when the financier paid the first of several visits to Tbilisi."

"The crew aboard the international space station reported hearing a brief metallic crunching noise, but ground-based experts found no evidence of damage... Astronaut Mike Foale told NASA's Mission Control the noise sounded as if something had struck the aft end of the Russian module that houses the crew's sleeping quarters, kitchen and lavatory. Both Foale and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Kaleri heard the noise at 2:59 a.m. EST Wednesday as they were completing their breakfast and cleanup period. 'It sounded like a metal tin can kind of being expanded and compressed,' Foale said. 'It was a noise that lasted about a second. It sounded like an impact or something.'"

"The head of an embattled Montreal chronic care facility who vanished Tuesday as controversy swirled around him and the institution he oversaw for seven years was found dead Wednesday in a Ste-Hyacinthe hotel. Police confirmed last night that Léon Lafleur, 56, the director of Charles Borromée Hospital, committed suicide... Lafleur had been at the centre of a media storm since Monday when he made light of employees who were caught on tape degrading a female patient at the hospital. Fearing she was being abused, her family hid a tape recorder inside her room. It captured employees humiliating and taunting her. In one taped excerpt widely reported by Quebec media, two staff members told the woman there was a man outside her woman watching her and <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/sex/masturbation/">masturbating</a>... He told <i>La Presse</i> on Monday that the rude comments about masturbation by an employee weren't to be taken seriously. 'It's black humour. It wasn't something done to frighten anyone. I'm convinced of that.'"

"A radio station that burned UKP5,000 in a breakfast show stunt is being investigated by the Radio Authority. Chrysalis Radio's Galaxy station in Birmingham sent the cash up in smoke after listeners voted to burn the money rather than give it to a listener who wanted to spend it on a breast enhancement operation. Despite Birmingham church representatives' impassioned pleas for the money to be given to charity, the station set the cash alight on November 13 in its <i>Bank it or Burn it</i> competition... Galaxy's stunt follows, albeit on a smaller scale, the precedent set by art-rockers the KLF who set fire to UKP1m on a remote Scottish island in 1994. Although the group said they burned real money the claim was never corroborated but the notorious stunt still provokes heated debate."

Spain immediately demanded an apology and an explanation from the Australian government. Spain's team was told not to begin play until the correct anthem, which was hastily found, was played... Spain's Secretary of State for Sport, Juan Antonio Gomez-Angulo, was fuming later, describing the incident as 'an offence to the Spanish nation.'

"Cut a banana in two pieces and ask a hungry 5-year-old to eat one piece. The child snatches the biggest one. But cut the banana in 'half,' and the decision comes more slowly. The child's doubt is an example of one of the most sophisticated mental talents that humans possess. It is called 'cognitive self-awareness,' 'metacognition' or 'thinking about thinking' - the ability to wonder whether one is making the 'right' judgment... researchers showed that rhesus monkeys and a bottlenose dolphin chose 'I'm not sure' with virtually the same frequency as humans when offered difficult choices. 'They know when they don't know,' said lead researcher John David Smith, a psychologist at the University at Buffalo of the State University of New York. 'You up the stakes and give them a behavioral way to opt out, and they take it. It's lovely to watch.'"
