"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will search for the remnants of 127 mustard gas canisters buried in a Central Florida airfield more than five decades ago because the chemicals could be dangerous to the public. The corps will spend $1.2 million to find weapons at the site, called Brooksville Army Air Field during <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wwii/">World War II</a> but now the Hernando County Airport. ... The airport, 7 miles south of Brooksville, is listed as one of about 10 'Code One' former Defense Department sites in Florida, meaning it carries the highest level of potential harm to the public, said Robert Bridgers of the Corps of Engineers.

A judge, a doctor, a prosecutor and three police officers called the case the worst child abuse they've seen. Burns, whip marks and open sores covered the boy's malnourished body. A patch of hair was missing from one of the times his mother duct-taped his entire head except for a mouth hole for him to breathe through. Bruises lined his neck from the dog collar he was forced to wear. The woman, whose name was not published to protect the boy and his siblings, pleaded guilty to child abuse. Her mother was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment earlier for her role."

"Some of the world's biggest banks worked closely with executives of Enron Corp. to hide the true nature of shady transactions from Chicago's Andersen accounting firm, according to a bankruptcy court investigation. ... the investigation stops short of clearing Andersen of wrongdoing at Enron, and some say any deception on the part of the banks did little more than help the auditors appear to be rigorous even if they were looking the other way.

"Over the last year, local and federal law-enforcement officials say they have noted a marked increase in teen prostitution in cities across the country... Law-enforcement agencies and advocacy groups that work with teen prostitutes say they are increasingly alarmed by the trend lines: the kids are getting younger; according to the FBI, the average age of a new recruit is just 13; some are as young as 9.  And, while the vast majority of teen prostitutes today are runaways, illegal immigrants and children of poor urban areas, experts say a growing number now come from middle-class homes."

"Francis Warin had a nagging habit. Nearly 30 years ago, he toted a submachine gun into Toledo’s federal courthouse and made a simple demand: <i>Arrest me.</i> He got his wish. Two months ago, the Ottawa County man mailed a homemade gun and silencer to an assistant U.S. attorney. To ensure there was no confusion, he sent the package by certified mail, complete with his return address. Warin again got his wish: He was arrested once more. ... the latest indictment took four years of taunting: threatening to bring a bomb to the FBI, boasting of illegal silencers he had made, and even taking out a newspaper ad to question why he hadn’t been indicted."

"A Seattle man charged with slitting his girlfriend's throat and trying to stab her friend believed God told him to do it because the two women were devils in need of eradication, according to court documents. ... Gamet has a delusional belief that God 'will overcome the lies of the "devils" (the victims),' attorney Robert McKay wrote in a request for Gamet to be evaluated to determine his competency to stand trial. ... Gamet 'insists on proceeding to trial where "God" will ensure his acquittal,' McKay wrote."

Harvard's Law School has already posted 7,000 pages on one of its own web sites but it says it needs as much as $7m to make the entire Nuremberg archive available. The massive project to put the one million pages of transcripts from the Nuremberg trials onto the internet is likely to take 10 years to complete. ... No startling new information about the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war-crimes/holocaust/">Holocaust</a> is expected to come to light if the massive internet archive is completed but scholars have welcomed the move."

"Drugs designed to relieve depression may be working because they stimulate the growth of new nerve cells in a key area of the brain, say researchers. ... The researchers found that when these animals given a modern 'SSRI' antidepressant called fluoxetine the number of neurons in an area of the brain called the hippocampus doubled. This area is known to be important in mood and memory, and accordingly, as expected, the mice showed fewer signs of anxiety. ... There is no certainty that a human brain will respond in a similar way to a mouse brain. However, Dr Tony Cleare, from the Institute of Psychiatry told BBC News Online that the theory made sense."

"The Malawi Prison Service has said homosexuality will remain a problem in the country's prisons since inmates are not open about it. ... 'Homosexuality exists, but it is done in secret when prisoners have been locked up in their cells and the victims are scared of reporting to prison officials for fear of repercussions,' Kainja said. ... Nkhoma said the prison service has been against the idea of distributing condoms among inmates for fear of encouraging homosexuality. 'We have been resisting attempts by some NGOs to distribute condoms in prisons because <i>that would immediately formalise homosexuality in prisons</i>.'"
