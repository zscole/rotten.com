somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates came to Watertown to talk to librarians about computers that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had donated. NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw also was in town and interviewed Gates at the Past Times Cafe, where they both ordered a cappuccino. But when the interview was over, they left and no one paid the bill. 'They just got right out the door, the security people ushered them right out,' said Jackie Harrington, the waitress who prepared and served the coffee." So what's the problem? The Past Times Cafe is probably owned by a huge corporation. One little act of theft isn't going to hurt their profit margin one iota. They should just do what Microsoft does: chalk it up to the cost of doing business and not make a big deal out of it.

"Legislation headed for the Senate floor would let the global eavesdropping agency automatically turn down requests by citizens for files on how the NSA collects intelligence. ... 'The danger is the NSA is reverting to the old Soviet Union here, where everything is per se secret and you don't have any means to get around it,' said James Bamford, who used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain thousands of NSA documents to write two books on the agency. 'Besides the score on the local golf course there, they can say pretty much anything is operational because everything has to do with NSA's operations.'"

Russian police have arrested the manager behind the high-concept pop music curiosity known as "t.A.T.u." Ivan Shapovalov has been charged with corrupting the morals of girls as young as seven, when he paid them to appear in the "lesbian" duo's new music video. Said the cops: "We wanted to stop him exploiting these young children. We didn’t know what he was going to do with them." Evidently, the video was for the Eurovision contest. As if you needed more proof that the guy behind this outrageous band's carefully-contrived image is nothing but Russia's answer to Malcolm McLaren.

When Olugbemia Olusajo was apprehended last year for identity theft, he decided not to make things too easy for the cops. So he pulled a move worthy of McGuyver: "Shortly after he was arrested, prosecutors said Olusajo tried to conceal his identity by soaking his fingers in a jail toilet, then chewing away the softened skin. He was unsuccessful, according to prosecutors." Good effort.

"Five Colombian stowaways emerged jubilantly from a ship they thought had docked in Miami only to discover they were still in their homeland after five days at sea." After their arrest, the quintet actually broke into song. "Police said the stowaways performed an impromptu rap dramatizing their tragi-comic story." That's what it says.

"A San Antonio man who allegedly padlocked his wife to a 30-foot dog chain in the backyard was in jail himself Friday. One end of the chain was padlocked to 45-year-old Patricia Thomason's neck, and the other end was attached to a car where her husband Jerry Thomason, 41, was sleeping when police arrested him Thursday at their home. Firefighters used bolt cutters to remove the chain that was wrapped around the woman's neck and padlocked." Well, what are you supposed to do when your wife wants a divorce?

"The disc-shaped 'personal location device' (designed to be implanted inside a person) measures 6.35 centimetres in diameter and 1.27 centimetres in depth -- roughly the same size as a pacemaker... Eventually the device will need to connect to a cell phone network if it is to relay the satellite-determined position of its host to another person..." Looks like it's a pipe dream at this point, but who knows?

"Popular wisdom in China holds that burping, breaking wind and coughing out phlegm is good for your health. But spitting, according to Liu Junzhuo, a professor of public health at Peking University, spreads diseases such as <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/epidemics/sars/">SARS</a>, which has infected 5,000 people in China, and tuberculosis, another killer with about five million sufferers in China."
