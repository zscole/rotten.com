"American interrogators here have come up with a few new weapons as they try to pry loose the secrets of prisoners captured on the battlefields of Afghanistan. 'It could be cupcakes, it could be Twinkies, it could even be a McDonald's hamburger,' says Warrant Officer James Kluck, who, as the ranking food service officer, helps supply some of the unlikely ammunition. 'Sometimes, they go up on the base and get [the prisoner] a Happy Meal.' A McDonald's Happy Meal? 'Oh, yes, from what I'm told. It's got a toy and everything.' ... There were a few glitches. It took the food vendor two months to round up a supply of fresh dates, for example."

"Former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy told a priest she was contemplating <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/suicide/famous/">suicide</a> after her husband was assassinated, a new book about the Kennedy family says. According to <i>The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings</i> by Thomas Maier, the first lady also told the Rev. Richard McSorley, 'I don't know how God could take him away,' and expressed guilt that she had not been able to shield President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/jfk/">Kennedy</a> from the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/kennedy/">assassination</a> in 1963. The book says Kennedy asked McSorley to pray that she would die. 'McSorley looked Jackie in the eyes. He felt compelled to dissuade her from thoughts of suicide, but he would not try to stop her from wishing for death itself,' Maier writes."

"For 40 years, the Archdiocese of Seattle hung onto the Rev. James McGreal, despite repeated complaints that he was a serial pedophile. ... Details have always been fuzzy about McGreal, who retired in 1988 and now lives in a locked treatment center. He is now the subject of four lawsuits, which are shedding light on the number of victims and the archdiocese's actions. The archdiocese has said fewer than 20 men have told it that McGreal abused them. But recently filed court records say that McGreal admitted to his therapist that he molested 'hundreds of victims.' Court records also show that the archdiocese knew of allegations against McGreal as early as the late '60s and that former Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen knew of McGreal's abuse in 1977. But it would take him 11 years to finally remove McGreal from ministry."

"The industry is trying to enlist broader public support with a campaign intended to show that its nemesis -— the peer-to-peer networks for swapping files like KaZaA and Morpheus —- are used not only to trade songs but also pornographic images, including child pornography. ... <i>'As a guy in the record industry and as a parent, I am shocked that these services are being used to lure children to stuff that is really ugly,'</i> said Andrew Lack, the chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment. ... The available evidence does not show that pornography on file-sharing systems is growing any faster than through other online vehicles. Indeed, the federally financed child pornography tip line run by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children found that 1.3 percent of the reports of Internet child pornography were related to file-sharing services so far this year, down from 2.1 percent last year. Nearly three-quarters of child pornography reported is on Web sites."

"A self-proclaimed security expert is accused of trying to extort money from some D.C. area shopping malls. Federal prosecutors charge Christian Kerodin demanded more than $120,000 from the company that owns the Fashion Centre at Pentagon City. In exchange, he said, the company's malls would be kept off a report that he was allegedly planning to issue about malls he considered vulnerable to <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/crime/terrorists">terrorist</a> attacks."

"Next Tuesday, tourists in Nepal will have the rare opportunity of seeing a living goddess. The opportunity is rarer than they think because six-year-old Preeti Sakya - the living Hindu goddess or Kumari - has been hidden away for six months during a row over who gets tourists' money. Her guardians say she should receive a fair share of the fee tourists pay for entry to Kathmandu's Hanumandhoka palace square where she lives. Municipal officials say they have to use the proceeds of the $2.50 fee to maintain the world heritage-listed site. Still, for one day at least tourists will be able to see the Kumari when she is borne in a palanquin - a covered litter - in a religious procession through Kathmandu."

"Mountains, beavers and the Maple leaf. And with a recent paleontological discovery Canada could soon gain international recognition for another natural wonder -- tyrannosaurid turds. A team of Canadian and American scientists recently identified an Albertan fossil as the world's largest dinosaur dropping, stealing the title from a <i>T. rex</i> turd found in Saskatchewan in 1995."

"As Parliament prepares to grapple with morally divisive issues such as same-sex marriage and reproductive technology, a new poll shows Canadians continue to support one issue the governing Liberals have done their best to avoid: the legalization of doctor-assisted suicide. When asked if they favour or oppose legalized euthanasia, 49 per cent said yes, while 37 per cent were opposed and 13 per cent were undecided. While the results show a clear plurality of Canadians would support such a change, the level of support is down from previous surveys."

"Cyber cafes in Navi Mumbai have stumbled upon a novel trick to stay afloat. Most cafes are now offering increased privacy to their patrons and the reason is not difficult to comprehend. If you have to sustain, you need to offer absolute privacy to customers to visit the sites of their choice, which more often than not means x-rated sites. ... Most cyber cafes in Vashi have small wooden cubicles, where customers often lock themselves for hours on end. A crisp 'do not disturb' instruction to the attendant, and the bliss is complete. Some of the more enterprising cyber cafes also offer patrons refreshments and soft drinks."

"It was billed as the one of the most dramatic warnings the world has ever received over the dangers of ecstasy. A study from one of America's leading universities concluded that taking the drug for just one evening could leave clubbers with irreversible brain damage, and trigger the onset of Parkinson's disease. ... But today, scientists are facing up to the humiliation of admitting that the stark results they reported in the study were not a breakthrough but a terrible, humiliating blunder. The study was based on the fact that laboratory monkeys and baboons had a severe reaction to the drug when it was injected in small doses. But it emerged this weekend that the vials of liquid did not contain ecstasy. Instead, the animals received a dose of methamphetamine, or speed -- a drug widely known to affect the body's dopamine system. The tubes had somehow been mislabelled by the supplier."
