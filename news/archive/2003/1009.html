"The Rev. John Johnston, 64, was a pistol-packing padre who had a stash of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/nazi/">Nazi</a> memorabilia and gay porn in his Jackson Heights apartment, police said. But perhaps the most evil thing the longtime religion teacher is accused of is breaking the Seventh Commandment by stealing as much as $100,000 from a Long Island church's collection... The Catholic priest's secret life was exposed when cops went to his apartment Tuesday night to bust him for allegedly making 'offensive and nasty' calls to the principal of Bishop Laughlin High School in Brooklyn... Johnston answered the door in a kimono - but what grabbed cops' interest was a huge wad of cash and a revolver sitting on a dresser... 'He had a whole shrine of Nazi memorabilia in his closet, Nazi flags, helmets, daggers, swastikas, German military medals,' the police source said. Before they left, cops also found two other handguns, .38-caliber and .32-caliber, as well as gay pornographic videos and magazines."

"A 19-year-old woman has been charged with first degree murder in the beating death of her 2 1/2-month old daughter who, according to shocked witnesses, was held by the ankles and her head slammed on the pavement... Stunned on-lookers told police they saw Jilanda Daniels holding an infant by the ankles and then slam the baby onto a curb shortly after 7 p.m. The witnesses said the woman then dropped the baby into the street and kicked her. Witnesses held the mother until police arrived."

The audiotape is from a hand-held video camera that Treadwell used to record his encounters with the bears, some of which weigh more than 1,000 pounds... the tape begins with sounds of Treadwell screaming that he is being attacked and calling for help to Huguenard, who was apparently still inside a tent."

"The Catholic Church is telling people in countries stricken by AIDS not to use condoms because they have tiny holes in them through which the HIV virus can pass - potentially exposing thousands of people to risk. The church is making the claims across four continents despite a widespread scientific consensus that condoms are impermeable to the HIV virus. A senior Vatican spokesman backs the claims about permeable condoms, despite assurances by the World Health Organisation that they are untrue... 'These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million.'"

"A Franciscan brother admitted Thursday to shooting a Roman Catholic priest to death in his office and setting fire to the church rectory with the body inside. Daniel Montgomery pleaded guilty to a charge of murder and a charge of aggravated arson in the December death of the Rev. William Gulas, pastor of St. Stanislaus Church... <i>'I want to say how truly sorry I am that this happened,'</i> Montgomery said, wearing an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs. <i>'I sincerely hope and pray that I may be rehabilitated and honor Father William's memory in that way.'</i> ... Franciscan officials had told Montgomery just before last Thanksgiving that he was being fired. Prosecutors said Montgomery was upset about the firing and may have shot the priest because of that... In a profanity-laced journal entry prosecutors say Montgomery wrote three days before the murder, Montgomery expressed his frustration with the church's criticisms of him."

Witnesses then said Andis raced alongside the passenger side of the truck, weaving toward the cab and yelling obscenities at its driver. Police said Andis pulled in front of the truck, which then clipped the bike and dislodged him and dragged him about 25 feet beneath its undercarriage...

"An Indianapolis police veteran is under criminal investigation after witnesses said the off-duty officer punched a paraplegic in the face, knocking him out of his wheelchair, after an angry exchange of words in an Eastside strip club. The Indianapolis Police Department internal affairs unit also is investigating the incident involving Detective Frank Hittel... The paraplegic, Michael Farmer, 22, of Camby, said he was struck so hard that some of his teeth were chipped."

"A Princeton graduate student said on Monday that he has figured out a way to defeat new software intended to keep music CDs from being copied on a computer - simply by pressing the Shift-key... John Halderman said the MediaMax CD3 software developed by SunnComm Technologies Inc. could be defeated on computers running the Windows operating system by holding down the Shift key, disabling a Windows feature that automatically launches the encryption software on the disc... The CD in question, Anthony Hamilton's <i>Comin' From Where I'm From</i>, was released by BMG's Arista label in late September. Music retailers praised the release, which BMG touted as a breakthrough in the industry's efforts to prevent music piracy."

"Airport screeners hired by the government to check baggage for bombs were given most of the answers to the tests they took to qualify for the job, according to an internal Homeland Security Department investigation. In addition, job applicants were not required to show they could identify dangerous objects inside luggage... During classroom training, screeners were given the questions in open-book quizzes and then the answers. The course ended with a closed-book examination of 25 questions. Nineteen of the questions on the final test were identical or virtually identical and three were similar to those on the quizzes."

According to the analysis conducted by Western media outlets, the 'potential enemy' implies NATO and the USA...

"Heroin dealers who target children as young as 12 with free samples and drug packets decorated with cartoon characters have spawned an epidemic of illicit heroin use in Massachusetts and New England, which now has the highest rate of illegal drug use among teenagers in the nation... Last month, a former Westford high school teacher was indicted on charges of selling heroin to her teenage students and helping them shoot up in her apartment... Dealers give children two bags of free heroin for every eight they sell in an effort to get them hooked, Menino said. Colombian cocaine cartels, which started showering the Massachusetts market with cheap heroin in the late 1990s, have employed sophisticated marketing tools to target young users, including brightly colored envelopes and brand logos like Batman, cartoon frogs, dynamite, and the <i>Playboy</i> bunny."

"Controversy always seems to surround pop icon <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a>. This time speculations are rife about his links with an alleged gangster, Al Malnik. Jackson is rumored to be making friends with Al Malnik, who has been linked with organized crime and is reportedly 'heir' to legendary crime boss of yore, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/crime/mafia/meyer-lansky/">Meyer Lansky</a>, says a report in <i>People News</i>... Forced to throw open the gates of his estate 'Neverland' for cash earlier this year, and embroiled in several court cases that may lead to huge pay-offs, the current state of Jackson's financial affairs is not good. This has led many to speculate that Jacko has been getting some money advice from Malnik. 'The word is that Al is helping Michael get out of debt,' said a source, who confirmed the whole Jackson dynasty has moved in with Malnik."

"Casino mogul Steve Wynn is one of the people who know Siegfried and Roy best. He is one of the duo's closest of friends and hired the illusionists when he built The Mirage in 1990... 'As Roy was leading Montecore out to stage front on a leash, the cat became fascinated and distracted by woman with a big hairdo in the front row. Instead of Montecore going down facing forward with Roy, he did a 90-degree turn and faced sideways towards the woman with the big hairdo. For whatever reason, Montecore was fascinated and distracted by the guest sitting ringside. Montecore got down on all fours and puts his 26-inch head four inches away from of the woman. She thinks this is adorable and part of the show and reaches out to try and rub him under his chin... Roy jumps between the woman and the tiger.'"
