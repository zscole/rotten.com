<b>Viewership</b><br>
On the first full day this page went live, 100,000 people visited this Rotten
News page. Of course that was the day after the WTC attacks, so that number is
somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"A sense of disbelief gripped this quiet community Monday after Harry and Darlene Calverley were slain by their son Bradley, who shot them after crashing his SUV through their home in the early morning darkness. He was later shot and killed by Lubbock County sheriff's deputies... Martha Summit found it hard to believe that her friends' son could kill them. Still, she said, Darlene Calverley had worried recently about Bradley Calverley. 'I understand he suffered from bipolar disorder,' Summit said. 'He had been taking medication, and he was fine as along as he took his medication.'" [<i>It's always the parricidal murderers who mess things up for the rest of us bipoles.</i>]

"Workers at a Philadelphia demolition site made a gruesome discovery Monday morning - a pile of human bones that had been tossed into a trash container. A crew working on the 4800 block of 7th Street, in the Logan area of the city, made the discovery, but police quickly traced the bones to another construction site at 6th and Catharine streets in south Philadelphia... On Oct. 1, excavation crews at the 6th Street site unearthed an unmarked cemetery and human skeletal remains. The builder who was putting up condominiums on the lot was ordered by the courts to rebury the bones at a proper burial site with a special marker... Sources said a construction crew whisked the bones away Monday afternoon in a truck after shoveling the remains out of the trash container and into a garbage bag."

"A former physician at a Fort Worth hospital has been indicted on a murder charge in the 2000 suffocation of a patient. The Tarrant County grand jury returned the indictment Monday, accusing Lydia Grotti of blocking the breathing tube of Lettie McGhee, 64, after the woman went into cardiac arrest... At a state hearing, Grotti had testified that she had pronounced McGhee dead an hour before blocking the airway, <i>The Fort Worth Star-Telegram</i> reported in Tuesday's editions. She testified that she blocked the tube to stop breaths that occur at death as the brain stem deteriorates. Grotti testified that although she regrets blocking the tube, the woman was already dead, the newspaper reported."

"Rabbis in Israel have reportedly been asked to approve plans to train pigs to guard West Bank settlements in a bid to thwart would-be Palestinian attackers from gaining 'martyrdom.' <i>The Maariv</i> newspaper reports that directors of the Gdud Haivri, an organisation which supplies guard dogs to settlements in the West Bank, believe that pigs' more developed sense of smell will enable them to sniff out militants who hide before launching attacks. 'Pigs' sense of smell is far more developed than that of dogs,' the firm's chief executive Gdud Haivri Yekutiel Ben-Yaakov told the paper. 'The pigs will also be able to identify weapons from huge distances and walk in the direction of the terrorist, thereby pointing him out. Moreover, this animal is considered to be dangerous by Islam and, according to the Muslim faith, a terrorist who touches a pig is not eligible for the 70 virgins in heaven,' he said."

"Authorities are investigating the death of a 16-year-old who was shot to death by a neighbor while playing a late-night prank. Mark Drewes and a friend were knocking on neighbors' doors and running away around midnight Friday when Jay Steven Levin said he mistook the 6-foot-2 teen for a burglar and "thought he saw something in Drewes' hand," according to sheriff's reports. Levin answered the knock on his door armed with a handgun and shot the teen, said sheriff's spokeswoman Diane Carhart... 'It's tragic. Teenagers are going to be teenagers. They are going to pull pranks,' said neighbor Barry Hahn. 'I don't think the proper response is to shoot a gun.'" [<i>How was the guy supposed to know the kid was playing a prank?</i>]

"A lot of big name stars are unwittingly about to start raising money for <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/religion/scientology/">Scientology</a>, thanks to <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/michael-jackson/">Michael Jackson</a>. At 3 p.m. PST Monday, Jackson is launching a worldwide Internet download of his charity single, 'What More Can I Give?' For $2 a shot, Jackson fans will be able to hear this record, made two years ago but never released... But what fans - and the two dozen participating artists - probably don't know is that proceeds from the single download are going, in part, to Scientology. Jackson has designated The HELP Organization, which uses study techniques developed by Scientology founder <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/cult/l-ron-hubbard/">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, as one of the beneficiaries of his largesse."

"Waco, Texas, will forever be known for the siege that began in February 1993 when agents of the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/batf/">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</a> raided a compound owned by the Branch Davidian religious sect to investigate allegations of weapons hoarding. A 51-day stand-off between sect members and the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/fbi/">FBI</a> ensued and ended on April 19 when the complex was tear-gassed and a fire engulfed the building. Eighty Branch Davidians died, either in the fire or from gunfire. The dead included their 33-year-old leader <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/cult/david-koresh/">David Koresh</a> and 17 children... The Davidians who still attend church at Mount Carmel every Saturday believe Koresh is coming back in the not too distant future.
