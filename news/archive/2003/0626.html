As the crowd of protesters grew larger, more vocal and confrontational, children began throwing rocks at the British patrol. ... The soldiers first fired warning shots with rubber bullets, al-Shawi added, before weapons fire came from the crowd. The troops then fired live ammunition into the crowd. ... Wedeman said the attacks across Iraq were harming the morale of troops, especially the Americans. 'Many soldiers are beginning to wonder why they are there given the levels of hostility...

Zainuri Lubis said authorities were still examining the sites in the central Aceh villages of Guci and Krueng Pase and had been told by villagers there may be as many as 300 bodies in the graves. ... More than 12,000 people have been killed in what observers have called one of the dirtiest wars in Southeast Asia.

"[M]ind-bending prison cells were built by anarchist artists 65 years ago during [Spain's] bloody civil war. ... Most were the work of an enthusiastic French anarchist, Alphonse Laurencic, who invented a form of 'psychotechnic' torture... [He] created his so-called 'coloured cells' as a contribution to the fight against General Franco's right-wing rebel forces. ... Beds were placed at a 20-degree angle, making them hard to sleep on, and the floors of the 1.8 metre by 0.9 metre cells were scattered with bricks and other geometric blocks to prevent prisoners from walking backwards and forwards... The only option left to prisoners was staring at the walls, which were curved and covered with mind-altering patterns of cubes, squares, straight lines and spirals which utilised tricks of colour, perspective and scale to cause mental confusion and distress."

"On a scorching afternoon, while on duty at an Army airfield, Sgt. David J. Borell was approached by an Iraqi who pleaded for help for his three children, burned when they set fire to a bag containing explosive powder left over from war in Iraq. Borell immediately called for assistance. But the two Army doctors who arrived about an hour later refused to help the children because their injuries were not life-threatening and had not been inflicted by U.S. troops."

Contrary to the prevailing theory that they had no written language, "the Inca did have a form of non-verbal communication written in an encoded language similar to the binary code of today's computers. Gary Urton, professor of anthropology at Harvard University, has re-analysed the complicated knotted strings of the Inca -- decorative objects called <i>khipu</i> -- and found they contain a seven-bit binary code capable of conveying more than 1,500 separate units of information. ... If Professor Urton is right, it means the Inca not only invented a form of binary code more than 500 years before the invention of the computer, but they used it as part of the only three-dimensional written language."

"The job appears simple, but there are hidden difficulties. The teen doesn't just have to fill the containers with dung. The samples, to be used by Saerheim Plant Research, need to be in pristine condition -- so Svein Tore has to get them before they hit the ground. ... There are plenty of challenges. If Hauge is too early the annoyed cow can bolt, if late then he loses much of the sample to the ground. And even when he gets it right, the pan doesn't get it all, sometimes his arm gets it, sometimes his face."

"A diamond necklace which <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/eminem/">Eminem</a> gave to a fan and said was worth £275,000 has been exposed as a fake. The rapper plucked Sian Fox, 19, from a crowd of 65,000 at a sell-out gig in Milton Keynes and handed it over. ... But the necklace and cross was later valued at just £50 by jewellery expert Dave Baddeley. He said: 'The chain is nickel and would probably stain your clothes if you wore it too much.' The stunt was supposed to prove that Eminem was not obsessed with money."

'I think that Christian Brando is the satanic cult in the Robert Blake case,' said Dubin, referring to the cult claims that have recently clouded the case against accused killer Scott Peterson. 'It makes for good media but has nothing to do with the truth.'"

"At least a dozen teenagers assigned to work with police departments as part of the Boy Scouts' Law Enforcement Explorers program have allegedly been sexually abused by officers during the past year. In the past five years, such molestations number at least 25, according to criminologists' research being released Wednesday. ... Explorers have been used on undercover pornography stings in which they enter adult bookstores and purchase materials banned for their age group. In other cases, scouting officials said, they have been allowed to drive marked patrol cars, which could expose them to harm from gang members and drug dealers."

"The Supreme Court of the United States did much more than strike down the Texas ban against homosexual sodomy Thursday. In the opinion outlawing the Texas statute, handed down in an electrified courtroom, the majority of justices ruled so broadly that the decision will keep government out of the bedrooms of all Americans. ... [<i>But of course, there are always dissenters.</i>] 'Today's opinion is the product of a court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda,' Scalia said, 'by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct.'"
