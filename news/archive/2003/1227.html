<b>Viewership</b><br>
On the first full day this page went live, 100,000 people visited this Rotten
News page. Of course that was the day after the WTC attacks, so that number is
somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"The family of a man whose body was donated to UC Davis Medical Center for research is suing the center after body parts from cadavers were found last summer in the possession of a former autopsy assistant. Alan David Scott and Terry Whitten filed suit in Sacramento Superior Court recently alleging negligence and the intentional infliction of emotional distress as a result of the discovery that their father's head had been kept in a bag stored in the assistant's tool shed for nearly 11 years. The suit, which does not specify a dollar amount sought, also names the assistant, David Lawrence Beale, and Pathology Support Services Inc., Beale's former employer, as defendants... Beale is accused of stealing more than 150 pounds of human remains from the medical center program over an 11-year period."

Both were charged with two felony counts of aggravated battery. Police said the boy struck the victims with the bat, and Greer also hit them... While Baures and the woman believe there were four or five attackers, Forest Park Police Chief Jim Ryan said police arrested the 'two major aggressors.'

"A government crackdown involving hundreds of riot police, barricades and the brutal demolition of businesses that had operated for decades is hardly something to sing about, especially when all the action was aimed at operators of <i>karaoke</i> stalls.  Osaka's Tennoji Park had been famous for years because of the people who used to set up makeshift humpies where people could come and belt out one of their favorite tunes for just a couple of coins at almost any hour of the day...  But the stall operators balked, understandable considering some of them had been working there for decades and they had built up a considerable <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/sex/homosexuality/cruisy-restrooms/">reputation</a> for themselves."

One passenger by the loo said: 'There was a woman facing the wall and her companion standing behind with his trousers round his ankles.

"An 18-year-old Lawrence man is charged with unlawful wire tapping for using his cellular phone to record a conversation he had with a police officer, police said. Police said Officer Daniel Lannon was questioning a group of shoppers while responding to a false 911 call made from a payphone outside the Market Basket at 350 Turnpike St. about 6 p.m. Tuesday. Lannon reported that Luis D. Dominguez, 47 Chelmsford St., repeatedly interrupted the conversation. Lannon told Dominguez that police did not need to talk to him. Dominguez then accused Lannon of being a racist and became combative, police said. As a 'loud verbal discussion' began between Dominguez and Lannon, the Lawrence teen used a feature on his cellular phone to record what was happening, said Detective Lt. Paul J. Gallagher. Lannon told Dominguez that recording the conversation was illegal, and asked him to stop. When the teen refused Lannon arrested him... Essex County District Attorney Mary Alice Doyle said unlawful wire tapping carries a maximum fine of $10,000 and five years in jail." [<i>Unbelievable. Should the LAPD have arrested the videographer of the Rodney King beating? If anything, it should be illegal to <b>prevent</b> a citizen from recording a uniformed police officer in a public space.</i>]
