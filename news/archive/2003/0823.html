"At the White House's direction, the Environmental Protection Agency gave New Yorkers misleading assurances that there was no health risk from the debris-laden air after the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/wtc/">World Trade Center</a> collapse, according to an internal inquiry. President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a>'s senior environmental adviser on Friday defended the White House involvement, saying it was justified by national security. The White House 'convinced EPA to add reassuring statements and delete cautionary ones' ... 'When EPA made a Sept. 18 announcement that the air was "safe" to breathe, the agency did not have sufficient data and analyses to make the statement,' the report says, adding that the EPA had yet to adequately monitor air quality for contaminants such as PCBs, soot and dioxin. ... it wasn't until June 2002 that the EPA determined that air quality had returned to pre-Sept. 11 levels -- well after respiratory ailments and other problems began to surface in hundreds of workers cleaning dusty offices and apartments."

You may remember that this infamous cousin of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a> was reported killed early in the war, during those heady days when 'smart bombs' supposedly solved big problems in Iraq. Well, it has since become obvious that the smart bombs weren't so smart and neither was the intelligence that guided them -- and that Chemical Ali (real name Ali Hassan al-Majid) was alive and well and on the run, just like Saddam himself. How he was caught this week, precisely, nobody in the Coalition is saying. ... But how do you make a man like this talk? ... Suspected bad guys are isolated and dependent for every bit of information they receive, even the time of day. The interrogators have the power to grant or withhold permission for every bodily function, including sleep. It's amazing how fast most people break down under such circumstances. If that doesn't work, the treatment can get rough."

"Former priest John Geoghan, a convicted child molester who was accused of sex abuse by more than 130 people, was killed in prison Saturday, according to safety officials. Geoghan was attacked by another inmate about noon and died shortly after being sent to Leominster Hospital, said said Department of Correction spokeswoman Kelly Nantel. ... Geoghan was a central figure in the church abuse scandal, which broke in early 2002 with revelations that the church had moved him from parish to parish even though authorities had been warned about his behavior. The scandal exploded after a judge ordered the release of archdiocese files involving dozens of priests, showing repeated examples of the archdiocese shuttling priests to different parishes after claims of sex abuse."

"A congressional report says the Pentagon computer systems are having trouble keeping track of all members of the military. And, the report says, that flaw has hampered the activation of about 300,000 reservists since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The report by the General Accounting Office says the military services have separate computer systems and not all of them are compatible. That meant some officials had to use desktop-computer spreadsheets to call up reservists. The investigators found that having inconsistent orders on how to activate units caused problems. For example, the Pentagon lost track of some reservists who had been called to active duty, kept some on active duty longer than authorized and kept units on alert to be activated for a year or more."

Authorities say the men intentionally shot a male victim in the groin on April 20, permanently injuring him. 'They took another individual out and shot him, and the bullet struck the victim's penis,' said Assistant District Attorney John Phillips, who is handling the case. 'I think they intentionally shot him in the crotch area. Whether they meant to hit what they hit, I can't tell you. It's a pretty outrageous place to shoot somebody.'"

"Brazil's president said Saturday his country's space program remains a priority despite a rocket explosion that killed 21 people, injured 20 and put a fiery end to Brazil's third attempt to enter space. The 66-foot-high VLS-1 VO3 rocket was three days from its scheduled liftoff when an explosion Friday destroyed it and its box-like launch pad.  The blast at the Alcantara Launch Center in northeastern Brazil killed mostly civilian technicians and destroyed two research satellites, dealing a serious blow to Brazil's nascent space program.  ... It is hard to assess just how serious a blow the explosion is to Brazil's space program because many of those killed were likely top scientists involved in the space program."
