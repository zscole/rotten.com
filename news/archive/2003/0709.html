"The San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to hire a new company to transport corpses to the coroner's office in the wake of charges that employees from a previous contractor sexually assaulted the body of a 4-year-old girl. ... In February, the county canceled its contract with All County Transport of Riverside after two of its workers, Donald Cooper, 32, and Chaunee Helm, 30, of Hesperia, were accused of assaulting the body of the 4-year-old, who died at a Victorville hospital after a seizure. The case sparked anger and frustration among family members, police and some lawmakers who learned that <b>California law does not prohibit sexual contact with a corpse</b>. For that reason, prosecutors instead charged Cooper and Helm with a felony health and safety code violation, that of mutilating a corpse."

"In an astonishing announcement on global warming and extreme weather, the World Meteorological Organisation signalled last night that the world's weather is going haywire. ... The unprecedented warning takes its force and significance from the fact that it is not coming from Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth, but from an impeccably respected UN organisation that is not given to hyperbole... The Geneva-based body, to which the weather services of 185 countries contribute, takes the view that events this year in Europe, America and Asia are so remarkable that the world needs to be made aware of it immediately."

"In a finding that is expected to rewrite medical textbooks, Canadian researchers have discovered that, for many women hoping to avoid pregnancy, there is no 'safe' time to have sex. ... in a finding that left even the researchers 'flabbergasted,' University of Saskatchewan scientists have found this pattern of follicular development actually occurs two to three separate times during a woman's menstrual cycle. ... The results help explain for the first time why some women get pregnant while on birth control pills, and why the window for safe sex may not exist at all for many women -- because there may always be an egg sac waiting to release an egg."
