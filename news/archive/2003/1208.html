"A retired deputy head teacher from Cornwall has been found guilty of indecent assault against 23 small boys... [Joseph Denley] had denied the charges of assaulting seven to 10-year-old boys at Marazion County Primary School over a 21-year period. Denley, 79, who lives in Alma Road in Penzance, was found guilty of 41 counts of indecent assault against 23 boys... During the case, former pupils told the court how they were assaulted by Denley who had put his hand inside their underpants when they were called to the front of the class... 'You regularly humiliated them and, in short, you ruled those seven to 10-year-olds with a rod of iron in a wholly inappropriate way and many of them spoke of living quite simply in fear of you.'"

"The spurt in violence in Afghanistan in recent months has generally been attributed to the resurgence of the Taliban and <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">al-Qaeda</a>. However, aid workers in Afghanistan are saying that it is warlords with connections to the production and trade of narcotics who are behind many of the attacks... This year's bumper poppy crop in Afghanistan seems to be financing a fresh proliferation of weapons among the warlords... Governments back home in the NATO countries are reluctant to get their soldiers drawn into tackling drug trafficking as this would make the troops targets of the all-powerful drug syndicates. Therefore, even if they come on a field of poppy or an opium warehouse, the troops are under instructions not to act against it. 'The troops have orders to look the other way. Orders from on high,' reports <i>Der Spiegel</i>, adding, 'An open confrontation with the drug lords would be like a declaration of war.'"

"Several studies published on Monday show that rats given a popular ADHD drug were less likely to want to use cocaine later in life, but also often acted clinically depressed and behaved differently from rats give dummy injections... William Carlezon of McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston and colleagues raised two groups of rats. One was given Ritalin, known generically as methylphenidate, during the rat equivalent of pre-adolescence, while the other was given a salt water injection... rats, which generally like cocaine, were less likely to eat it if they had been give Ritalin."

"When Neal Smither reached the scene, the police and paramedics still hadn't figured out how to get the body out of the tub. Crime Scene Cleaners, his company, specializes in 'homicide, suicide, and accidental death' clean-up and had been called to solve the problem. During the time the body had been allowed to rot, the flesh had expanded more and more, until it finally sealed the bathtub like a cork. 'Their problem was that they couldn’t get their hands around him to strap him and yank him out of the tub,' remembers an amused Smither. The police needed Smither to help them poke a hole under the man’s collarbone. 'We were then able to feed our water pump hose through the hole, turn it on and release the pressure which allowed the body to sag a bit and lift him out.'"

"Thousands of fans rioted at Sierra Leone's national stadium Saturday when authorities substituted two local dwarf comedians for a widely anticipated out-of-town midget duo... Fans rioted, throwing projectiles and smashing windows, light fixtures and hundreds of chairs. Witnesses said police fired tear gas. Authorities said 30 people were arrested, including eight who allegedly had tried to steal the stadium's seats. Dozens of show-goers were reported injured in the melee. Saturday, blood splattered parts of the stadium."

"The enchanted minds at DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) - an arm of the DoD - have funded the Segway Robotic Mobility Platform (SRPM), which is a modified version of the fabled scooter designed for more military pursuits. At present, researchers scattered throughout U.S. universities are dabbling with the SRPM to see what kinds of tasks a robotic version of the Segway can handle. Armed with various sensors, hardware add-ons, and software packages of their own design, the groups are hoping to prove the Segway could be used to perform scouting operations, recover wounded troops or even one-day do battle... DARPA's interest in the scooter could not come at a better time for Segway LLC. During a mandatory recall earlier this year, it was revealed that a paltry 6,000 Segways have been sold."
