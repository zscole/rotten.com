somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

Former CIA Director James Woolsey said in an interview with CNN that releasing the photographs is necessary. 'Normally, we would not do this,' he said. 'But I think it's necessary for the world to see and particularly for the Iraqis to see that these two are, in fact, dead, that this is not some ginned-up story from the United States.' ... Army .50-caliber machine guns and 10 Humvee-mounted TOW missiles were used in the assault and Sanchez said it's believed the missiles probably killed the brothers."

"The software that runs many high-tech voting machines contains serious flaws that would allow voters to cast extra votes and permit poll workers to alter ballots without being detected, computer security researchers said yesterday. 'We found some stunning, stunning flaws,' said Aviel D. Rubin, technical director of the Information Security Institute at Johns Hopkins University, who led a team that examined the software from Diebold Election Systems, which has about 33,000 voting machines operating in the United States. 'With what we found, practically anyone in the country -- from a teenager on up -- could produce these smart cards that could allow someone to vote as many times as they like.' ... Peter G. Neumann, an expert in computer security at SRI International, said the Diebold code was 'just the tip of the iceberg' of problems with electronic voting systems."

The Traditional Values Coalition (TVC) portrays its campaign as a moral fight for the 'sanctity of life.' ... A recent TVC letter sent to Congress was signed by the coalition's executive director, Andrea Sheldon Lafferty. It was originally drafted, however, by Tony Rudy, a lobbyist for pharmaceutical companies and a former top aide to House Majority Leader Tom DeLay... Several Republicans said pharmaceutical companies, through their lobbyists, contacted other conservative groups, including the Christian Coalition, about waging a similar campaign against the reimportation measure.

InterTrust's engineers developed and patented what they say are key inventions in two areas: so-called digital-rights management and trusted systems. ... Though InterTrust declines to place a pricetag on the suit, it's hard to imagine the company settling now for any sum that does not have a 'B' in it. InterTrust claims that its inventions cover technologies that Microsoft has been weaving into its Windows XP operating system, Office XP Suite, Windows Media Player, Xbox videogame console, and .NET networked computing platform, to name just a few."
