The baby's father, David Tribble, said the family had strong Baptist beliefs and believed in the healing power of God, but were not part of any extremist sect or cult.

Stanley Staniszewski, 60, who worked as a 'helper' priest at several Catholic churches in the Diocese of Orlando, said he was unaware of any charges and that the calls were made as 'a joke' and that he was 'under the influence of medication'...

"Scientists have successfully immunised mice against the deadly ebola virus which has killed thousands in Africa. They used virus-like particles (VLPs) which are non-infectious but are capable of triggering a strong response by the immune system. Usually lethal doses of ebola had no impact on the vaccinated mice... Colonel Erik Henchal, commander of USAMRIID, said: 'This is astonishing work. The ability to produce self-assembling particles that resemble whole virus will give us a new tool to evaluate the combination of variables required to produce a protective immune response to ebola virus.'"

"Male and female students at McMaster University were shown pictures of the opposite sex of varying attractiveness taken from the website <i>Hot or Not</i>. The 209 students were then offered the chance to win a reward. They could either accept a cheque for between $15 and $35 tomorrow or one for $50-$75 at a variable point in the future. Wilson and Daly found that male students shown the pictures of averagely attractive women showed exponential discounting of the future value of the reward. This indicated that they had made a rational decision. When male students were shown pictures of pretty women, they discounted the future value of the reward in an 'irrational' way - they would opt for the smaller amount of money available the next day rather than wait for a much bigger reward. Women, by contrast, made equally rational decisions whether they had been shown pictures of handsome men or those of average attractiveness."

"Several Supreme Court justices expressed concern yesterday about a new police tactic that they called an 'end run' around the requirement that officers inform suspects of their rights... The tactic, described in some police training manuals and promoted on a website on policing, involves two rounds of questioning of a suspect at the police station - the first to get a confession without advising the suspect of the right to remain silent and have a lawyer, the second to have the confession repeated after giving what are known as Miranda warnings."

"The Supreme Court has not taken up the question of what is considered obscene since 1973, before the VCR and the Internet revolutionized how people view porn. In the landmark case <i>Miller</i> v. <i>California</i>, the nation's top court ruled that communities around the country had the right to apply local standards in deciding what is considered obscene... Today, adult entertainment companies say the Internet, and cable and satellite television, allow buyers to access porn in the privacy of their homes without affecting the community around them or the standards of the people who live there... If something is downloaded directly into a person's home, does the community still have the right to decide what its local members are allowed to see?"
