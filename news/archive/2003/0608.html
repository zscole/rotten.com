"Tuwaitha, Iraq's largest nuclear facility and now defunct, was left unguarded for two weeks after Iraqi troops fled the area on the eve of the war. U.S. troops didn't secure it until April 7. In the meantime, looters from the surrounding villages stripped it of uranium storage barrels they later used to hold drinking water. The U.S. military ordered villagers to sell back the barrels for $3 US each. The Pentagon said they had retrieved 100 barrels so far. Some 3,000 barrels of low-grade uranium were stored at Tuwaitha." A spokesman said that "about 20%" of the plant's uranium stockpile is missing.

The cashier, 19-year-old Chiquita Gennell Oliver, threw the fries on the couple's tray, then threw a punch, police said. Police said when the couple left the restaurant, they were met by a car filled with four people... Police said Oliver, her mother and another woman passenger took turns beating the 23-year-old woman, while a 17-year-old boy armed with a handgun attacked and robbed her 29-year-old companion."

"Another battered truck hauling what appears to be a dazzling fortune in gold bars was stopped at a routine U.S. Army checkpoint in Iraq on Wednesday, the third such cache of bullion seized in two weeks. An officer with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the unit that detained the truck near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, said that 1,183 ingots were recovered in the latest bust. ... More than 4,100 gold bars have been confiscated so far from the rusty beds of old trucks trundling down the bomb-cratered roads of Iraq. The combined value of the gold has been calculated at between $718 million and $1 billion -- the worst act of plunder in Iraq since <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/saddam-hussein/">Saddam Hussein</a>'s younger son, Qusai, swiped $1 billion in cash from the Central Bank."

"[I]f David Lee Roth is the world's most renowned circumcised rock star, something is terribly wrong in the universe... With his homeless-person tan, hideously stringy mop of straw topping his thinning, vein-encrusted pate and countenance so craggy it calls to mind the folds in Louie Anderson's torso, Roth has 'ugly white guy' written all over him. ... Jews simply do not behave as flamboyantly as Roth; we never choose to call attention to ourselves as we go about the business of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/hoaxes/zion-protocols/">world domination</a>. We don't flit about onstage smelling of Aqua Net and testicle sweat; we don't prance about like Richard Simmons with vibrating ben-wa balls shoved up our ass. We prefer to work our subjugating power discreetly, behind the scenes, quietly colluding with <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/religion/satan/">Satan</a> and controlling every facet of your foolish, goyish existence."

"John the Fearless had a toilet that enjoyed all the facilities that the technology of the day had to offer. ... 'It was state of the art. The pit was covered to stop smells filtering upwards. On the street of course the filth was everywhere but in the homes of nobles, cleanliness was paramount,' said Daniele Alexandre-Bidon, a hygiene specialist at the School for Higher Studies in Social Sciences in Paris." [<i>That's right, he's a French hygiene specialist.</i>]

"The Houston Chronicle quotes two unnamed Republican sources as saying Governor Perry will call a special session and put redistricting at the top of his list. ... You may recall a month ago, when state house Democrats left Texas in order to shut down the state legislature. They were trying to kill a Republican-led plan to rob West Texas of a congressman and give that position to Central Texas. ... [W]ill house Democrats again leave the state to stop the measure? 'I don't think there's any plan. There wasn't any plan when this came up,' says Laney, D-Hale Center."
