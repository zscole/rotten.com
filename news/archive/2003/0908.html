somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"One of the Britons released last month from a Saudi jail has said he was tortured 'beyond endurance' during his imprisonment. Sandy Mitchell said he was chained, beaten and denied sleep until he confessed to a crime he did not commit. ... 'The beatings started with punching, kicking, spitting, and eventually progressed to hitting me with sticks. They had this axe handle and I was beaten on the soles of my feet.' Mr Mitchell told the <i>Sunday Times</i> that he had been told his death sentence was to have been a <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/execution/crucifixion/">crucifixion</a>, which involves the victim's head being partially severed and their body fixed to an x-shaped cross and hung in public for three days."

The resulting wave, a metre high judging by traces on the walls, swept through the Jivans's house in Hazelnut Street, Lotus Garden, covering everything with effluent. ... 'The sewage started bubbling up through our toilet. The initial surge forced the door of the loo to close, but when it reached handle height it just burst through, flooding the house,' Bengali Jivan said. ...

"The Court of Appeal in The Hague last week rejected all of the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/religion/scientology/">Church of Scientology</a>'s claims its action against the Dutch ISP Xs4all, writer Karin Spaink and ten other internet providers for publishing copyrighted material on the web.  As a result, Spaink's website which Scientologists had sought to remove, is entirely legal. The court also overturned two lower court rulings, one of which stated that linking to material that infringed a copyright was itself actionable. The victory for Xs4all represents a significant narrowing in the ability of copyright claimants to harass ISPs, observers believe."

The process, widely used across Colorado and the rest of the West, injects diesel fuel, hydrochloric acid or other additives into the ground to help boost production.

"The first phase of <i>Operation: Last Chance</i>, a Simon Wiesenthal Center <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/nazi/">Nazi</a>-hunting venture in the Baltics, was so successful, according to the Golden Beach investment manager who financed it, that it's being expanded to other countries. Aryeh Rubin, 53, leaves today for Warsaw, Bucharest and Vienna, offering $10,000 to anyone whose tips lead to arrests and convictions of Poles, Romanians and Austrians guilty of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wwii/">World War II</a> atrocities. 'The <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war-crimes/holocaust/">Holocaust</a> has basically been forgotten or <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/racism/holocaust-denial/">denied</a> in these places,' said Rubin, who believes it's never too late to track down elderly Nazis and their collaborators. 'I am tickled pink that these bad guys who did these horrible things have a little more angst in their waning days that someone is looking for them. These guys got away with it in 95 percent of cases.'"

'Only eight percent have sex daily. <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/sex/masturbation/">Masturbation</a> and extramarital sex, associated with guilt across the world by women, have few takers in India,' said the poll.

"As a Benedictine monk, Patrick Wall cleaned up and covered up the sins of priests -- pastors who were quietly transferred when their sexual and financial trespasses threatened to ignite public scandal. He was the affable replacement -- a ruddy-faced, Irish-American priest whose fondest desire was a life of study and worship -- a fireplug of rugged intensity and emanating faith. So it was that Father Patrick, born to devout Catholics in a small Minnesota town, went from one mess to the next, his spiritual path and career trajectory charted by the mistakes of fallen brethren. ... His ability to bridge the secular and clerical worlds serves him well in his current job -- as adviser to a Southern California law firm representing more than 50 sexual abuse victims, a client population that grows each week, suing the Los Angeles archdiocese and the Orange, Calif., diocese."

"It has become almost commonplace in urban and suburban areas for a student to bring a date of the same sex to the prom -- and that in most schools, it’s really no big deal. Today's school administrators say they want an event that's welcoming for everyone. ... In 1980, a Rhode Island youth named Aaron Fricke had to fight all the way up to the U.S. District Court for permission to bring a friend, Paul, to the Cumberland High School prom. Although the court ruled that making a statement about sexuality is federally protected free speech, the date was still considered so scandalous that it made national headlines. But when Sophia Lanza-Weil arrived at her Portland, Oregon prom a few weeks ago, it garnered barely a notice. 'She wore a suit but I wanted to wear a dress,' said Lanza-Weil, who shared the night with her girlfriend."

"In a lengthy commentary carried late Sunday night on the official <i>Xinhua News Agency</i>, authorities called for a 'fight until the end' against Falun Gong, which has repeatedly angered the government in recent months by hacking into Chinese television satellite signals and broadcasting its own messages. 'We should be fully aware that the fight will be long, arduous and complicated, and therefore, we must be vigilant against the Falun Gong cult and should in no way relax our efforts,' it said. It also accused Falun Gong practitioners overseas of impeding China's fight against <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/epidemics/sars/">SARS</a> by 'instigating followers at home to block the epidemic prevention' -- a charge the movement denies. <i>Xinhua</i> did not elaborate."

Flynt has said that he wants Hustler Hollywood to appeal to women. Certainly he's enjoyed newfound popularity among anti-Republican feminists since jumping to <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/">Clinton</a>'s defense during the impeachment scandals, and lately he's been downplaying <i>Hustler's</i> distinctive raunch, insisting that it's all just 'plain vanilla' sex.

"As the second anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks approaches, the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration’s war on terror has produced a secondary battle: fierce struggles in Congress, the courts and communities such as these over how the war on terror should be carried out. At the heart of this debate is the USA Patriot Act, the law signed by President Bush 45 days after the terror strikes that enhanced the executive branch’s powers to conduct surveillance, search for money-laundering, share intelligence with criminal prosecutors and charge suspected terrorists with crimes. Yet the paradox of this debate is that it is playing out in a near-total information vacuum: By its very terms, the Patriot Act hides information about how its most contentious aspects are used, allowing investigations to be authorized and conducted under greater secrecy."
