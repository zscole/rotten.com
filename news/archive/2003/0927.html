"Polish police have detained the father of a six-year-old girl whom he apparently kept locked in a cage in his garden shed for years. ... They found the girl, known only as Marta, malnourished, naked and covered only by a blanket in a cage 4ft high and 3ft long. The girl had difficulty standing when freed and apparently cannot speak properly. According to the police, Marta's parents had locked her in the cage because they believed that the girl was retarded and should be kept in isolation."

In April of 1938, Mussolini told Holy See representative Pietro Tacchi Venturi the Vatican should adopt harsher measures against Hitler such as excommunication, according to Venturi's own account of their talks. ... The Vatican archives relating to pre-war Germany were opened ahead of schedule in a bid to counter charges that the Vatican did not do enough to prevent the Holocaust. But questions will likely remain until the files from 1939 and on are opened."

"Discovery of such remnants of Iraq's drone program since U.S. forces seized Baghdad in April has left Air Force officials feeling vindicated. They argued before the Iraq war that the drones were never meant to spread toxins but to fly unarmed reconnaissance missions. The CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency and other government intelligence groups disagreed with that assessment. They contended the drones, known in military jargon as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), were intended to carry <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wmd/biological-weapons/">biological</a> or chemical agents and therefore posed a particular threat to Iraq's neighbors and to U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region. ... In a speech in Cincinnati last October, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> expressed concern that 'Iraq is exploring ways of using these UAVs for missions targeting the United States.' Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spoke of the same possibility in his presentation to the U.N. Security Council in February. What the Bush administration did not reveal until recently was that the government organization most knowledgeable about the United States' UAV program -- the Air Force's National Air and Space Intelligence Center -- had sharply disputed the notion that Iraq's UAVs were being designed as attack weapons. ... Air Force assessments 'all along' had cited reconnaissance -- not weapons delivery -- as the purpose of the Iraqi UAVs."

Problem was, it belonged to construction workers for Weeks Marine, a company hired by the city to replenish the beach. And those workers were fed up with outsiders using the company can. They retaliated, Tremmel claims in a lawsuit filed last month, by driving a bulldozer or front-end loader to the toilet and blocking the doorway, pinning him 'inside the rank tomb.' Tremmel is seeking $100,000 for the Aug. 19, 2001, incident."

"James 'Stu' Long, a 19-year old UCSB film studies major didn't care -- like many people at the party -- that his face might show up in crowd footage that could later be spliced into a pornographic College Fuckfest video and sold online. He had little sympathy for girls who feel exploited by their appearance in such films. 'If the girls are drunk enough and stupid enough to get on the videos, then that's what they deserve,' Long said."

"A federal judge on Thursday said he will give the Interior Department another chance to account for money owed to American Indians, setting a 2007 deadline but expressing little confidence the department will act. 'It is not that the court believes Interior is incapable of formulating an adequate plan for an accounting; rather, it is that the court has <i>no confidence</i> that Interior is <i>willing to actually implement</i> an adequate accounting,' U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth wrote in his ruling. ... Ultimately, the accounting will be used in a future trial to determine how much the government owes more than 300,000 Native American landowners for mismanaging their money."

"Once thought virtually eradicated in the United States, the bedbug is back. ... By the end of 2002, the little bloodsuckers had been reported in at least 28 states. And that could be just the start of a much larger problem. 'It's still at the beginning stages,' Kansas State University entomologist Ludek Zurek said of the bedbug's return. 'I'm predicting it's going to get worse. Nobody knows why it's coming back.' ... Bedbugs, which are classified as ectoparasites, have been increasingly found in residences -- and that spells trouble. While hotels and motels must tackle a bedbug problem immediately for their financial well-being, individuals might not initially recognize a bedbug infestation in their homes. Even after a person realizes there's a problem, he or she might not know how to fix it."

"A claim that the yeti does not exist has been greeted with a chorus of stern disapproval by leading Nepalese officials and commentators. The row began when a claim by a Japanese mountaineer, Makato Nebuka, that the yeti is really a meti, or Himalayan brown bear, was labelled 'controversial' and ultimately 'fallacious' in a front-page analysis in the daily <i>Kathmandu Post</i>. ... Although the yeti has long been a part of Sherpa belief, the first physical evidence of the species' existence were giant footprints photographed by Eric Shipton on the 1951 Everest expedition. Shipton, who enjoys a posthumous reputation as a joker, is regarded as the father of a tradition which has included mountaineers frolicking on Everest in gorilla costumes."
