"Two men have been charged with manslaughter over the death of a student involved in a 'human catapult' stunt. Bulgarian teenager Kostadin Yankov was killed last November when he was thrown from a replica medieval catapult. He should have landed in a large safety net during the event at Middlemoor Water Park, Woolavington near Bridgwater, Somerset. But he hit the ground before he reached it, sustaining serious injuries, and died later in hospital."

"Before the invasion of Iraq many commentators wondered what the American exit strategy would be -- how would they disentangle themselves from a lengthy commitment to nation-building? Now the talk is not so much about the end-game -- instead US commanders in Iraq are seeking a containment strategy to minimise the threats facing their troops every day. ... The Pentagon's insistence that it is not facing a guerrilla war seems to be undermined by the facts on the ground with clear suggestions that there is more co-ordination behind the attacks than defence department chiefs would like to admit."

"A senior American politician has warned that North Korea and the United States could go to war as early as this year over Pyongyang's alleged nuclear weapons programme. William Perry, who served as defence secretary under former President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/bill-clinton/">Bill Clinton</a>, told the <i>Washington Post</i> newspaper the key issue was that North Korea appeared to have begun reprocessing spent nuclear fuel rods, a key step towards building up its nuclear arsenal. ... The situation with North Korea 'was manageable six months ago if we did the right things. But we haven't done the right things,' the Democrat politician added. He said he had not criticised President <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">George W Bush</a>'s North Korea policy up to now because he hoped the problem was going to be acted on, but he said 'time is running out, and each month the problem gets more dangerous'."

"Some of the great works of English literature could be scrapped from the syllabus of one of Pakistan's leading universities because of what professors fear is a rising tide of Muslim fundamentalism. A review of books studied in the English courses at Punjab University in Lahore singled out several texts, including Alexander Pope's <i>The Rape of the Lock</i>, Ernest Hemingway's <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, and Jonathan Swift's <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> as containing offensive sexual connotations which were deemed 'vulgar.' ... The review appears to have been triggered by complaints made about the syllabus by the wife of a retired army general. She criticised the inclusion of two poems, including one by WH Auden, which she said promoted Jews, and a poem by Vikram Seth, who she said was too pro-Indian. She also said the poems of Adrienne Rich were unsuitable for study because she is a lesbian. 'We have been tolerant for too long,' the general's wife said in a meeting with academics from the department."

"American-born historian Dr David Mosler told a Brisbane audience yesterday there was a 20 per cent chance of Australia becoming an American state in the next 50 years. The visiting research fellow at Adelaide University, who has lived in Australia since 1971, said the chances would increase significantly in the event of a major <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda/">Al-Qaeda</a> attack on Australia or if Indonesia became a fundamentalist Islamic republic."

"A 12-year–old British girl and the ex–US Marine who have run away together may have flown on from Paris, police said today. ... Mr Studabaker's family defended the actions of the former marine, claiming that he had been convinced he was meeting a 19-year-old student rather than a 12-year-old schoolgirl. ... 'When she first e-mailed him, she said she was 19,' Mrs Studabaker told <i>The Independent</i>. 'She said she was a student at college. He didn't know.'"

"Lasagne is British. It's so British the court of Richard II was making it in the 14th Century and most likely serving it up to ravenous knights in oak-panelled banqueting halls. The claim has been made by researchers who found the world's oldest cookery book, <i>The Forme of Cury</i>, in the British Museum. A spokesman for the Berkeley Castle medieval festival, with whom the experts were working, said: 'I defy anyone to disprove it because it appeared in the first cookery book ever written.'"
