somewhat distorted. Right now this page gets between 50,000 and 75,000 people

"Since the disappearance and death of his 6-year-old son Monu in October, Narendra Kumar has learned that he was kidnapped and killed in a ritual human sacrifice. The perpetrators were childless neighbors who were desperate to have a son of their own. It was the 25th killing this year linked to Tantric practices... All five of the accused - including the childless couple, two of their relatives, and a Tantric priest - have confessed to killing Monu in a mango grove not far from the village. According to police documents, the wife confessed to bathing in Monu's blood, under priest's instruction."

The <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration maintains that thousands of pages of reports about the Foster death and more than 100 photographs have already been released, and five government investigations concluded that the death was a suicide."

"A team of military lawyers recruited to defend alleged terrorists held by the US at <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/crime/prison/camp-x-ray/">Guantanamo Bay</a> was dismissed by the Pentagon after some of its members rebelled against the unfair way the trials have been designed, the <i>Guardian</i> has learned. And some members of the new legal defence team remain deeply unhappy with the trials - known as 'military commissions' - believing them to be slanted towards the prosecution and an affront to modern US military justice... 'The first day, when they were being briefed on the dos and don'ts, at least a couple said: <i>"You can't impose these restrictions on us because we can't properly represent our clients."</i> When the group decided they weren't going to go along, they were relieved. They reported in the morning and got fired that afternoon.' The Pentagon's recently set up Office of Military Commissions denied the claim. 'That is not true, never happened,' said its spokesman."

"The Italian Senate has approved a controversial measure which allows Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to consolidate his media domination... One provision of the bill is to reverse a court ruling that Mr Berlusconi's Mediaset company must sell off one of its three TV stations by 1 January... The bill contains a number of different provisions, including the creation of multi-channel digital broadcasting. It will also lift the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in 2009 and increase the amount of advertising that one single company can have. Both measures will increase the profitability of Mr Berlusconi's companies."

"At the beginning of the French and Indian War (1754), the British government demanded that Acadians take an oath of allegiance to the Crown. Most of them refused. British Governor Charles Lawrence retaliated by deporting the Acadians from the area and dispersing them among the 13 colonies. Many colonies refused to take refugees and deported the Acadians back to Europe. This was referred to as the Grand Dérangement (or Great Expulsion) of 1755."

Smith said he organized squads of his employees into 'rat patrols' to police the multilevel LaGrou Cold Storage Inc. warehouse at 2101 W.
