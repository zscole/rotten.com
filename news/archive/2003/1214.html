"Robert Freeman rubbed his eyes with his right hand and pleaded for forgiveness for the mauling attack of his six dogs that led to the death of his 81-year-old neighbor on Friday afternoon... On Friday, deputies said a few of the dogs had to be tranquilized with a dart gun before they could be removed from Freeman's home. At least two of the dogs had blood on them, deputies said. Deputies said Broom, who had just returned from a doctor's appointment, was lying naked and unconscious on the ground, her clothes having been ripped off, and she had numerous gashes and lacerations over her body. Detectives learned from the Medical Examiner's Office onSaturday that injuries, from her head to her legs, caused her to bleed to death, according to Sheriff's Maj. Mike McQuaig. Freeman told deputies that when he arrived on the scene, the dogs were 'still chewing her up.' He told deputies that he yelled at the dogs before running into her home to call 911."

"The little green man leaped from behind the ice cream in the freezer and taunted Raymond Rodriguez to chase him. The next thing Rodriguez remembers, after blacking out, was waking up the following morning lying on top of his mother's lover and drinking partner, Daniel San Miguel, 77, whom he discovered was dead with a knife in his chest... Rodriguez testified Wednesday that he was forced to consume a letter-size sheet of LSD earlier on the evening San Miguel died and was having hallucinations by the time he got to his house, where his mother's lover was sleeping... When he opened the refrigerator, he noticed the bologna and cheese were dancing around. Then he opened the freezer door. 'I saw a green man when I moved the ice cream,' Rodriguez testified, nodding affirmatively and looking sternly at the jury. 'He looked cute. I wanted him. He had hands and feet and looked like a little man. He jumped out and said, <i>"Catch me if you can ... !"</i> So I tried to catch him.'"

"A Swedish-based artist who habitually kills animals for use in her work had no intention of giving up the practice, her gallery said yesterday after protests from animal rights defenders. Ukraine-born Nathalia Edenmont was reported to public prosecutors yesterday by the Swedish Veterinary Association for failing to have a veterinarian present when killing the animals she photographs... The photograph that has provoked the strongest reactions portrays a hand with the head of a dead mouse stuck on each finger. [Gallery owner Bjoern Wetterling] said the work was meant to symbolise the five stars of the former Soviet Union, which he said was responsible for the murder of Edenmont's mother when the artist was only 14...

"Two friends of novelist Michael Peterson are pushing the Durham district attorney to reopen the case of the convicted killer because of information they say points to another culprit. Larry Pollard and Nick Galifianakis contend an owl killed Peterson's wife in December 2001... Pollard listed 11 'points of evidence' that he said support the theory of an 'owl strike.' He noted the number, shape and location of the gashes to Kathleen Peterson's head... Galifianakis and Pollard have recently discussed exhuming the body of Kathleen Peterson to test her scalp for owl DNA, though Galifianakis acknowledges that her family and most judges probably wouldn't agree to the process."

"A KBR sign adorns the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/crime/corporate/halliburton/">Halliburton</a> corporate headquarters near downtown Houston, December 12, 2003. The company has removed the Halliburton name from the building and renamed it KBR (Kellogg, Brown and Root) amid controversy that surrounds the company's White House links and overbilling the government for military contracts in Iraq."

"A plan to build an 80ft statue of <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/actors/arnold-schwarzenegger/">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> in Terminator guise in his home town has been revived despite the actor regarding it as a waste of money. Councillors in Graz, Austria, first proposed putting up the statue in a park last year but shelved the plan after Schwarzenegger asked for the £3.5 million earmarked for it to be donated to a children's charity instead. Opponents also felt that the steel statue of the futuristic cyborg killer would be out of keeping with the medieval centre, dwarfing existing statues of Mozart and Emperor Franz Joseph... Despite the likely appeal of a Terminator statue, detractors have argued that it would destroy the charm of Graz." [<i>Ya think?</i>]
