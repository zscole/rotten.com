Out in the bush, unseen, are other children: the seekers armed with AK-47s, clubs and knives. It is a game played every night in the nearby towns and villages, an area stretching for hundreds of miles. If the hiders are found by the child warriors of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), they experience one of three outcomes: they are killed on the spot, marched into the bush and killed, or marched into the bush and forced to become killers themselves. ... The LRA is led by Joseph Kony, an elusive mystic, thought to be in his 40s, who wants to rule Uganda according to the 10 commandments. ... There are documented cases of recruits forced to kill relatives, to march over spilled brains and to cook and <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/death/cannibalism/">eat human flesh</a>."

"A federal judge in Manhattan ruled Tuesday that then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani violated the free speech rights of a city police officer and two firefighters by firing them for donning blackface and riding on a controversial float during a 1998 Broad Channel parade. The government 'may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because a segment of society finds it offensive,' U.S. District Judge John Sprizzo wrote in a 54-page decision. ... The trio break-danced, brandished watermelons and fried chicken containers, and pretended to re-enact the killing of James Byrd, a black man dragged to his death in Texas. The float, the three said, was a parody of the stereotypical views of their white neighbors. [<i>Sure, sounds reasonable.</i>] The three were fired in October 1998 and immediately filed suit seeking their jobs." With photo of the float.

"The rapper, who appeared as the host on one of the raunchy strip videos, says he's done with the series because it doesn't feature women of color. 'If you notice, there hasn't been no girls of (ethnicity) at all on none of those tapes,' <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/music/snoop-doggy-dogg/">Snoop Dogg</a> complained that the videos feature no black or Hispanic women, only white women. Snoop Dogg said he plans to do his own version of 'Girls Gone Wild' to satisfy women of color waiting for their chance to go topless for the camera."

"Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, the Iraqi 'disinformation minister' who became world renowned for his ridiculously inaccurate news briefings in Iraq soon before coalition troops reached Baghdad, was captured at a Baghdad roadblock, London's <i>Daily Mirror</i> reported Wednesday. The <i>Washington Times</i> also reported that the Iraqi official, also known as 'Comical Ali,' was detained early Monday evening near the home of a relative. But U.S. Central Command has not yet confirmed that Al-Sahaf is -- or is not -- in custody. A public affairs officer noted that Al-Sahaf is not on the U.S. military's most-wanted list and was 'never being pursued.'"
