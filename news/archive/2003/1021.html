"Since the end of the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/vietnam/">Vietnam War</a>, presidents have worried that their military actions would lose support once the public glimpsed the remains of U.S. soldiers arriving at air bases in flag-draped caskets. To this problem, the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/">Bush</a> administration has found a simple solution: It has ended the public dissemination of such images by banning news coverage and photography of dead soldiers' homecomings on all military bases... A White House spokesman said Bush has not attended any memorials or funerals for soldiers killed in action during his presidency as his predecessors had done, although he has met with families of fallen soldiers and has marked the loss of soldiers in Memorial Day and Sept. 11, 2001, remembrances."

Mahathir, who steps down at the end of the month after 22 years in power, told the <i>Bangkok Post</i> in an interview that widespread criticism of his recent remark that 'Jews rule the world by proxy' proved he was right. 'The reaction of the world shows that they control the world,' he told the newspaper... Mahathir said reports Bush had rebuked him were wrong. 'Certainly, he did not rebuke me,' Mahathir told a news conference after the two-day summit ended. 'All he said was that <i>"I regret today to have to use strong words against you,"'</i> Mahathir said. 'After that we were walking practically hand-in-hand.'"

"<a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/dictators/lenin/">Vladimir Lenin</a> is getting a fashion makeover. The legendary Soviet leader, embalmed in 1924, is to be given a new outfit that may even include a colourful new tie... His remains were originally clad in a Red Army military jacket, but he was changed into civvies -  the familiar dark, sombre suit - just before the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wwii/">Second World War</a>... The project coincides with the regular dipping of Lenin's remains into a secret chemical solution that keeps him looking lifelike almost 80 years after his death."

"Eric Alvarez of Harlem was found dead on the tracks between two stations in lower Manhattan at about 4:45 p.m. Monday, said Det. Carolyn Chew. While Alvarez was riding home from school, his friends dared him to climb to the top of the train, a practice known as 'subway surfing,' said Marisa Balde, a spokesperson for New York City Transit. He apparently had climbed the rear of a car and had reached the top when his head struck a steel beam in the ceiling of the subway tunnel, Balde said. Another train ran over the tracks where Alvarez had fallen."

"Methane bubbles from the sea floor could, in theory, sink ships and may explain the odd disappearances of some vessels, Australian researchers reported on Tuesday. The huge bubbles can erupt from undersea deposits of solid methane, known as gas hydrates. An odorless gas found in swamps and mines, methane becomes solid under the enormous pressures found on deep sea floors. The ice-like methane deposits can break off and become gaseous as they rise, creating bubbles at the surface."

"With the help of two graduate students, the two professors were able to light a small bulb by simply squeezing a syringe of ordinary tap water through a glass 'filter' with microscopic-sized holes they call microchannels. They invented their 'electrokinetic' water battery by harnessing the natural energy that is created on a very tiny scale when a flowing liquid meets a solid surface, creating an electrical charge. Water forced through a microchannel results in the movement of positive and negatives ions in such a way that one end becomes positive and the other negative. The inventors are particularly excited by the fact the electricity is produced cleanly and involves no moving parts. The discovery could in a matter of years lead to batteries for everyday items such as cellphones and calculators being powered by pressurized water."

"John D. Simrin, 39, of Monroe, is charged with first-degree robbery for the Oct. 1 incident. At 8:27 that morning, Simrin allegedly entered the bank, located on Sicklerville Road, and handed a bank teller a note demanding money. Simrin told the woman he would 'blow her head off' if she didn't cooperate... Simrin left the bank and fled the scene on an oversized tricycle, authorities said."
