"At about 8 a.m. a Pleasant Grove man told his mother he was <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/Jesus_Christ/">Jesus Christ</a> and ordered her to leave her home on High Country Drive in Orem. The man's mother called police for help. When officer Shane Fredrickson arrived at the home, the man became violent, said Orem Police Lt. Doug Edwards. Fredrickson tried to stun the man with a Tazer gun - but it had little effect. [<i>Did he really expect that thing to work on <b>Jesus</b>?</i>] Then, Edwards said, the man attacked the officer, biting him on the finger through his glove. The right index finger, according to Edwards, was badly damaged. The fingernail was ripped off and the tip of the bone broken."

"Glen Campbell was arrested at his Phoenix home Monday on suspicion of drunken driving and aggravated assault... Phoenix police Sgt. Bill Niles said he was forced to restrain the entertainer's arms and legs after Campbell raised his knee and struck Niles on his right thigh during questioning at a police substation Monday evening. Campbell, 67, also attempted to kick another officer after striking Niles, but the officer dodged the blow and was unharmed, Niles said... 'He was having mood swings and ended up taking his knee and raising it to me and hit me above the knee area,' Niles said. 'There was a lot of <i>"Do you know who I am?"</i> A lot of profanities. He didn't think he should be treated like a common criminal because of who he was. He went from calm and cooperative to becoming very loud.' Phoenix police Sgt. Randy Force said Campbell also kicked a patrol car and the door of his holding cell at the police substation. When Campbell was inside the intake facility at Madison Street Jail in Phoenix, he could be heard singing his hit song "Rhinestone Cowboy." ... Campbell acknowledged in an interview with <i>The Arizona Republic</i> last month to struggling with bouts of alcoholism and abusing cocaine, but said he stopped using the drug 20 years ago when he met his wife, Kim."

Police said the coven, in which several indications of Satanist activities were found, was discovered on Thursday last week. This comes after pastor Pieter de Beer of the Hope church had a vision in which he saw a snake slithering into a big hole... According to the Satanist calendar, the period between July 20 and 27 is a time of sacrificial preparation. July 27 is the culmination of this sexual ritual and female sacrifice."

"A Muslim chaplain accused of taking classified material from the U.S. prison for terrorist suspects in Cuba was charged Tuesday by the military with adultery and storing pornography on a government computer. The military released Army Capt. James Yee from custody and will allow him to return to duty at a base in Georgia... Authorities arrested Yee, 35, in September and charged him with disobeying an order for allegedly taking classified material from Guantanamo and improperly transporting it... The new charges include making a false statement, storing pornography on a government computer and having sexual relations outside marriage, which violates military law. The adultery allegedly occurred with an unspecified woman at Guantanamo and in Orlando, Fla., between July and September 2003, and the pornography was on his government-issued computer at the base in eastern Cuba."

"[Sara Stano] said she chose Delta Airlines for their trip from Portland, Ore., to Greensboro, N.C. because it was the only airline that promised to allow all three cats as carry-on luggage. But Stano said when her family went to check-in, they were only allowed two cats as carry-on and were forced to check the other into the cargo area. Once they arrived in Greensboro, the cat was dead... Stano's mother told reporters her daughter's account of what happened next. 'She said the man in Greensboro came up to her, handed her the kennel and just said, <i>"Here's your cat, we don't know what happened"</i> and he turned around and walked off."'"

"A Vilseck-based doctor who used drugs while in Amsterdam, then bloodily botched an attempt to give a fake <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/bodily-functions/pissing/">urine</a> sample to Army authorities, will go to jail for a year... Knowing he could be subject to a random drug test at any time, Munnell said he had stored a sample of 'clean' urine in his office at the Vilseck Medical Clinic before he went to Amsterdam. [<i>That's called planning ahead.</i>] When the surprise drug test came Jan. 2, he took the sample and tried to inject it into his bladder. Instead, he badly injured himself. 'It didn’t work as I intended,' Munnell told the court. 'It caused uncontrollable penile bleeding.' ... He got treatment at a German hospital."

"Doctors and experts are baffled by an Indian hermit who claims not to have eaten or drunk anything for several decades - but is still in perfect health. Prahlad Jani, a holy man, or <i>fakir</i>, who is over 70 years old, has just spent 10 days under constant observation in Sterling Hospital, in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad. During that time, he did not consume anything and 'neither did he pass <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/medicine/bodily-functions/pissing/">urine</a> or stool,' according to the hospital's deputy superintendent, Dr Dinesh Desai... A statement from Ahmedabad's Association of Physicians says that despite no water entering his body, urine nonetheless appeared to form in his bladder - only to be re-absorbed by the bladder walls."

"Psychologist Margaret Singer, an expert on brainwashing and cults, has died. She was 82. Singer, who studied the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/cult/reverend-jim-jones/">Peoples Temple</a>, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/religion/cult/david-koresh/">Branch Davidian</a> and Symbionese Liberation Army among other groups, died Sunday after a long illness at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley... Singer testified in the 1976 bank robbery trial of newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, who was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army. She interviewed more than 3,000 cult members, assisted in more than 200 court cases and was a leading authority on schizophrenia and family therapy... In a 2002 interview with the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, she told how, at 80, she had frightened off someone who'd been leaving menacing notes in her mailbox. <i>'I've got a 12-gauge shotgun up here with a spray pattern that'll put a three-foot hole in you, sonny, and you'd better get off my porch, or you'll be sorry!'</i> she shouted out the window."
