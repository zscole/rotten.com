"A Gannett News Service search found identical letters from different soldiers with the 2nd Battalion of the 503rd Airborne Infantry Regiment, also known as 'The Rock,' in 11 newspapers... The <i>Olympian</i> received two identical letters signed by different hometown soldiers: Spc. Joshua Ackler and Spc. Alex Marois... The five-paragraph letter talks about the soldiers' efforts to re-establish police and fire departments, and build water and sewer plants in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, where the unit is based. <i>'The quality of life and security for the citizens has been largely restored, and we are a large part of why that has happened,'</i> the letter reads... Six soldiers reached by GNS directly or through their families said they agreed with the letter's thrust. But none of the soldiers said he wrote it, and one said he didn't even sign it... A seventh soldier didn't know about the letter until his father congratulated him for getting it published in the local newspaper in Beckley, W.Va. 'When I told him he wrote such a good letter, he said: <i>"What letter?"'</i> Timothy Deaconson said Friday, recalling the phone conversation he had with his son, Nick. 'This is just not his (writing) style.'"

The accusation was made by fellow politician, deputy Pia Guzman, who said the trio were caught on video at what she called 'depraved orgies.' ... A 15-year-old boy allegedly told police he had been invited to a party by Mr Spiniak where young boys were paid 30,000 pesos ($46) for sex. Deputy Guzman said police were in possession of 300 videos, including 80 graphic ones, and the politicians could be seen in some of them."

"The 'Spanish Flu' influenza virus that killed 20-40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction. Several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains... These experiments may easily be abused for military purposes, but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view. The 1918 Spanish Flu was highly infectious and – in comparison to contemporary flu viruses – killed a very high percentage of those infected, including many younger people. The Spanish Flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the US in 1918 to drop by 10 years. Hence, flu viruses are perceived today as a serious <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/history/war/wmd/biological-weapons/">biological warfare</a> threat. Just two weeks ago, a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the US to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses."

Under U.S. law, it would be illegal to provide money or other material support to the designated Web sites, the people who run them could be denied U.S. visas and U.S. banks must block their funds.

The truck carrying the vessel broke an axle en route between Charlevoix and Gaylord, Mich., and it pulled over to the side of a road, where it was fixed. The company then parked the truck Tuesday night near a gas station -- that also serves as a bus stop for 13 elementary and high school students -- until the waste can be transferred to a train that stops in Gaylord. The truck was still there this morning... 'How much sense does it make in a post (Sept. 11, 2001) world to park this thing near a gas station?' Kamps said, saying a flame or spark could have started a fire that would have led to bigger problems."

Treasury Department investigators posing as regular citizens asked Internal Revenue Service help centers about their taxes. The IRS managed to give incorrect answers to a whopping 43% of questions asked. In other words, if you want to know how much money you owe the IRS, don't ask the IRS. Ask someone competent instead. The Treasury Department estimates that at that rate, a half million people were mislead by the IRS during the 6 months of the investigation alone.
