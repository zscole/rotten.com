"<i>All You Need</i> has an air of youthfulness, with its rollicking live music, fresh-faced performers and quirkily episodic sensibility. If the wry tone sometimes recalls the radio show <i>This American Life</i>... <i>Sweeney Todd</i> redux this isn't; Shuch uses the metaphor of consumption to investigate all forms of desire. Jesse Howell and Jennifer Chien retread the 'eat me' exchange as a tentative sexual proposition: 'It's gonna hurt. ... It's not safe,' they warn. An ensemble dance to the old standard 'All of Me' takes on sinister shadings with the lines 'take my lips... take my arms.'"

"Schools are bracing themselves for the annual exam-time rise in arson attacks on their buildings next month amid fresh warnings of a sharp increase in the number of school fires, which cause hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage and put pupils' lives at risk... May is the peak time for malicious fire-setting in schools, thanks to a combination of exam pressure, warm weather and lighter evenings, with children - the main culprits for arson - more likely to be outside. New figures released by Zurich Municipal, the main school fire insurer, reveal that the number of large fires causing at least £100,000 of damage rose by 55% in 2003, with the national cost of school fires standing at £73m... School fires in 2003 had less impact, in cash terms, than the previous year, when record blazes created almost £100m of damage."

"Every Easter Sunday on the small Greek island of Chios a fireworks war breaks out between two rival parishes. In a bizarre but long-cherished local tradition, two Orthodox churches in the town of Vrodandos fire rockets at each other's churches - while mass is held. The objective is to hit the other church's bell, but many rockets go astray, causing locals to rush frantically for cover... Residents also admit it is not the most safety conscious of ceremonies, with several fires in recent years sparked by rockets and even a few deaths. 'We live as hostages to this tradition,' one local lamented."

Where once there was only ice wilderness, now there is a packed surface 20 feet wide and lined with green flags, winding through huge crevasse fields, snow 'swamps' and flat pack ice. After two summers of hard going, the $20 million South Pole Traverse Project has covered 425 miles, and manager John Wright is convinced it can be completed, though not by next summer as originally hoped."

"The U.S. Forest Service has been accused of misrepresenting forest conditions by using misleading photographs in a brochure that urges more logging to prevent wildfires in the Sierra Nevada. The pamphlet, created by a public relations firm, explains that fire risks have risen as the Sierra's forests have grown more dense the past century... The 1909 photo shows an open, park-like forest with large trees spaced widely apart. More trees and underbrush appear in each successive picture - 1948, 1958, 1968, 1979 - and finally a photograph thick with trees in 1989... However, the 1909 photo does not depict natural conditions - it was taken just after the forest had been logged. And the pictured forest is nowhere near the Sierra Nevada. It's in Montana."
