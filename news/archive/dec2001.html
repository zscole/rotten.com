A reporter from the Wall Street Journal stumbled across a computer for

"In June 2000, Lynne Palmer, a 69-year-old Las Vegas resident, published
her Astrological Almanac for 2001 (Star Bright Publishers). On page 95 of
the book, buried among advice on the best days to go to the movies and worst
days to lend people money, Palmer had written, in an odd combination of the
obvious and the prophetic: <i>Avoid terrorist attacks on
September 11, 2001.</i>" [Yes, if enough psychics predict enough things,
some of them will end up being true. I am not even sure what the credibility
of the "Boston Phoenix" is, or whether that book was actually published
in June. But it should be noted that Pluto and Saturn were aligned that day,
and perhaps the terrorists knew this!]

<br>
Palm reading is perhaps more lucrative than any of us realized.
The town of Plantation is seeking possession of $1.8M that was found 
in an old pickup, seized in a drug raid in which 161 grams of
cocaine was also taken. Of course, the money has no connection with
the cocaine: "That money is not what you think -- it is my mother's
life savings for the children when we die." Our crystal ball doesn't
seem to agree with that assessment-- it's mostly tens and twenties.

In the 19th century thousands of mummies were exported from Egypt during

Bolehall Manor in England, and when that museum closed they were buried in
the foundations of a building that was later turned into a McDonald's

a potential source of their "mystery meat"?

This article certainly starts out juicy:

tell us what the "disturbing details" are, and furthermore seems to
contradict itself by stating that the explosives were purchased during a
physical, non-virtual trip to Amsterdam. It's almost as if the two

of ass crack can be sexy, at least when it comes to nubile young
women. Plumbers and other repair personnel should remain suspendered:

There are trace amounts of hempseed oil in various foods. No big deal,
not enough to have any effect. But the <i>War on Drugs</i> sees this as a
threat, and it must be banned! It's your patriotic duty to destroy that food:
"If you wish to err on the side of caution, you may freely dispose of the
product. As stated in the rules that DEA published on Oct. 9, 2001, anyone
who has purchased a food or beverage product that contains THC has 120
days (until Feb. 6, 2002) to dispose of the product without penalty
under federal law." What foods might be affected? Beer, cheese, coffee,
corn chips, energy drink, flour, ice cream, snack bars, salad oil,
soda, and veggie burgers! [Just in case you thought DEA chief Director
Asa Hutchinson wasn't a total fuckhead.]

use an encrypted connection. Of course, this is a reaction to a terrorist

the usage patterns change when we tell them we're listening.

Kevin Mitnick at one time was the most wanted computer hacker fugitive
in the world, and eventually was railroaded into jail for crimes that should
have garnered only a slap on the wrist. From an FCC memo: "Mr. Mitnick's
criminal background raises a substantial and material question of fact 
as to whether he possesses the requisite character qualifications to be
and remain a commission licensee. Given his propensity to engage in criminal
activities, particularly those involving fraud, we have serious reservations
about Mr. Mitnick's ability to comply with our rules and 
regulations in the future."

<font size=-1>CNS | Submitted by: Soylent</font>
<br>
Senators Charles Schumer and Edward Kennedy are using the terrorist
attacks of 9-11 as an excuse to introduce a bill that is a de-facto
registration of firearms. Never mind that the terrorists that day
used nothing more complicated than fists and boxcutters, and that
gun registration has never been demonstrated to have <i>any</i> negative
effect on crime whatsoever. It would be, however, one more intrusion of
government on the lives of ordinary people.

The niece of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, one Princess Buniah al-Saud,

The Princess claimed diplomatic immunity, but that has been stripped because
of her sketchy INS status. "The princess would yell at me, and say she's 
'Al-Saud,' and I was under her feet, that she can do anything to me here.
She said, 'I can kill you and nothing would happen to me.'"

An Israeli company, Amdocs, provides the equipment that the FBI uses

Israeli government, and the forces that are stopping investigations into
the mechanisms of the actual equipment itself are rather suspicious and
intriguing. "A 1999 F.C.C. document indicates several government
agencies expressed deep concerns that too many unauthorized non-law
enforcement personnel can access the wiretap system. And the FBI's own
nondescript office in Chantilly, Virginia that actually oversees the CALEA
wiretapping program, is among the most agitated  about the threat."
Powerful interests are at work here.

<br>
A group founded by the Vice President's wife, Lynne Cheney, and the 
influential Senator Joseph Lieberman has created a blacklist documenting
campus speech activities that they find un-American.
"The report documents 117 campus incidents as 'evidence' of anti
Americanism. More than 40 professors are named, including the president
of Wesleyan University, who suggested in an open letter that 'disparities
and injustices' in American society and the world can lead
to hatred and violence."

A Japanese man, Kazuo Yamafuji, claims to have invented a scooter

which was demonstrated on Good Morning America one week ago.
The Segway involves many different patents and inventions, and this claim
is only conflicting with one or two of them, which will not invalidate the
other patents. Yamafuji's patents are only valid in Japan, but may demonstrate
prior art that invalidates portions of Kamen's, if the claims here are true.

<font size=-1>Associated Press | Submitted by: Macki</font>
<br>
For the first time, President George W Bush has invoked executive
privilege to prevent documents from landing into the hands of dangerous
U.S. Congressmen. Bush claims release of these papers would be
"contrary to the national interest", so one would presume these have to
do with terrorism. This is not the case; the documents have to do with
a Clinton fund-raising investigation, murder investigations in Boston
from more than ten years ago, and snitches to the Justice Department.
The move is part of a concerted effort by the administration to keep 
potentially embarrassing documents out of public hands, by throttling FOIA
requests by the public as well as requests from customary 
Congressional oversight committees.

For the first time since its prohibition, the FDA has approved a human

MDMA is not patented, thus support for its approval has had to come from

"Twelve will receive 125 milligrams of MDMA on two occasions, and eight will get a placebo. Neither the patients nor Dr. Mithoefer will know who got what." How anyone could not know whether or not they're on E is a mystery indeed.

Lots of people sent rotten.com email bitching at us for our criticism
of U.S. Attorney General Ashcroft, who stated that supporting constitutional
rights was implicit support for terrorism. Ashcroft has repeatedly said
that lack of government power is in large part responsible for the terrorist
attacks on American soil, and he has pushed through as many sweeping new
powers as he possibly can (the misnamed "Patriot Act"). When in fact it is
the government being <i>asleep at the wheel</i> and the misdirection of its
energies to idiotic crusades such as the drug war, instead of paying attention
to things that really matter, foreign and military policy. Richard Reeves 
here has a thoughtful OpEd on the subject.

It purchased property in Australia from which it planned to mine natural uranium for enrichment - an arduous task beyond the resources of most nations. In 1993, Aum representatives sought a meeting with then-Russian Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov for the express purpose of discussing the purchase of a nuclear warhead. (The meeting was denied.)"

"While researching secret codes used prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor 60

The good news is that Tennessee park ranger Anthony Griffin was able
to shoot a man who tried to pull him out of his car, in an attempted
carjacking. The bad news is that Griffin was partially out of uniform, 
had just dropped off a prostitute, and is now on administrative leave.

The University North Dakota Fighting Sioux hockey team is under fire from
Native American groups ("prairie niggers") over their team name. A large 
donation by Ralph Engelstad is contingent on the team keeping the moniker.
"Mr. Engelstad's past fuels the determination of the anti-name crusaders. In
addition to Hitler birthday parties, Mr. Engelstad's casino also once held a
secret shrine to the Nazis, according to a 1989 investigation by the Nevada
Gaming Commission. The room had flags and cars that once belonged to Hitler as
well as matching paintings of Mr. Engelstad and Hitler in uniform. A caption
said: <i>To Ralph, from Adolf, 1938.</i>"

<font size=-1>The Register | Submitted by: Soylent</font>
<br>
The company that markets the ReplayTV device is claiming patents on the 
obvious invention of the computer-as-VCR. These are similar patents to those
owned by TiVo, which are equally bogus. Alarmingly, in recent years the
patent office has been granting numerous software and technological patents
not based on the implementation of devices, but on the ideas the devices
represent. This is a fundamental misinterpretation of what patents are supposed
to be about. What results are patent claims that stop any instantiation of
the idea, and not the actual invention itself. Yes, the circuit and design
used should be patentable. But not the idea.

Tumors in the "129" strain of white laboratory mice have led to

Stems cells are cells that can grow into any of the various body
cell types. "Mouse and man came together when Dr. Stevens noticed
a huge swelling on the animal's scrotum." [All the <i>best</i>
discoveries start like that!] "You would cut them and little bones
would crunch... you would see cartilage, and little black areas
where the melanocytes were. There were twitching muscle cells. There
were areas full of skin and hair."

When a DC cop gets a ticket for speeding or running a red light sent to him
by the automatic camera system, he has to pay the fine. Even if the ticket
occurred during emergency business, unless they go through great efforts of
justifying their actions. So a lot of cops are now waiting at red lights,
and not speeding, even when emergency beckons. But the real question is, why
does the American public put up with surveillance ticketing?

Nothing is unusual about a man suiciding in front of a train, except in
this case, a very drunk Jonathan Gundry "stuck his tongue out and put his
thumbs in his ears", and then let the train splatter him. He was 38.
[Jonathan earns 15 points for style, but suffers a 50 point penalty for
inconveniencing commuters. Too bad.]

Osama has $25M on his head, George W Bush $50M on his. And now, 
the Taliban is offering $50,000 to anyone able to kill a Western
journalist in Afghanistan. Many news agencies are already pulling
out of the country, among them the BBC. Northern Afghanistan
isn't really controlled by the Northern Alliance anyway, it's pretty
much under authority of bandits.

Police in Australia were filmed beating a suspect with a rather
long wooden plank. Whether or not it was a deserved beating (police
claim that it's perfectly acceptable: "I cannot see the problem"),
the fact that film of it is available has generated a lot of controversy.
