Another opinion piece. We don't like to post opinion pieces, but in this
case we have the Press Secretary of the US advocating assassination. This guy
(Ari Fleischer) can be a true idiot sometimes: "The cost of one bullet, if
the Iraqi people take it on themselves, is substantially less than going to
war." Fleischer needs to consider the fate of one of his predecessors:
"It is Fleischer who really needs to watch what he says, or at least to do
some homework about his job. He could start in 1981, when a man who stood in
the exact place where Fleischer plies his trade today, Ronald Reagan's press
secretary, Jim Brady, suffered permanent brain damage from an assassin's
bullet aimed at his boss's head. Reagan recovered from the attempted
assassination. Brady is still dealing with the cost of that one bullet."

youths of the future, sitting dreamily on air conditioned thrones,
will be no match for their squat toilet neighbors, the worker bees of
industrial China or the spartan soldiers of North Korea. But in a
country with the demographics of Florida, the real growth will be medical
toilets linked to the Internet." Will they have improved download times?

"Protestors who picketed a sex shop in Barnsley have pulled out after a
five month campaign, because they've proved good for business. But they
insisted their vigil outside Direct Pleasures at Stairfoot was a success,
despite admitting they had given the business a lot of publicity. The
store, Barnsley's second sex shop, opened in April sparking protests
from more than a dozen placard-waving adults and councillors."

"Gardner-Webb University has been embroiled in controversy ever since
the school's president admitted he wrote a memo two years ago ordering
a star basketball player's GPA to be calculated without an F he received
for cheating, in, of all things, a religion class. Without the change,
Carlos Webb would have been ineligible in 2000-01, the season Gardner-Webb
won the National Christian College Athletic Association championship."

"Four boys, each no older than 11 years old, made their way down a dirt
road amid row after row of parked recreational vehicles. Their eyes were
wide with excitement and their giggles filled the air. Wearing shorts and
T-shirts, they could have been on their way to hook up with some buddies
to play tag. Perhaps they were already on some secret mission their
imaginative minds had conjured up... The infield at Talladega Superspeedway
is a place where a businessman by day can let his grass skirt down before
the big race. It wasn't until a beautiful woman walked nearby that the
reason for their giddiness was revealed: <i>Show us your tits</i> they
screamed in high-pitched unison."

"Whether he's intended to be a gay character or not, that's the question
people are asking," responded Mr. Kenny. Describing Squidward as a fussbudget
who likes bubble bath and classical music, Mr. Kenny ultimately dodged the
question. "It's never been addressed by us on the show," he said, adding
with a wink that besides, "all the main characters are hiding horrible
secrets of their own."
